It would be a PC league for sure, as we would use a mod that we would make. \n\nHere are some of the things that we would do with this league\n\n* 8-16 teams of 5 players each, in a season style tournament that would play games on a set time, most of them on a stream that would be casted.\n\n* Active balancing, we would work to patch the mod as much as possible. Here are some changes we were planning to add to help diversify the game\n\n1. Removal of Juggernaut and Stopping power, to allow more diversity in the 2nd Perk slot, those two feel very over used. We would a lot Stopping power damage to every weapon (balancing would have to be looked over) in the absence of SP so that sniping isn't completely unviable.\n\n2. Buffing many under used weapons and sidearms. We'll use the Uzi as an example. Our plans were to decrease spray of the Uzi, make it more accurate, lower recoil, and give it a little more range.\n\n* Each week, 1 team would play two 'series'. Each team would play 3 games of our selected game types on that week's maps. Currently we had planned game modes of Sabotage, SnD, and HQ (HQ is the most tentative). Who ever won the series gets the win for that week. So lets say a team plays 22 series in a season, they would end up playing 66 games in total.\n\n* Stats would be tracked and recorded on our website, Kills, deaths, assists and would be displayed on the player pages. \n\n* The mod we use for our league play would be public and would have it's own servers for players to play on. It would cycle through the 3 game modes and throughout the maps that we have chosen to keep in the cycle. Eventually if it grew enough, we would add a ranked system and have players be able to play \"ranked matches\" so that we could match players up with others of their skill level.\n\nThanks for you time!

Once the case is opened through the community, the customer can respond via email2case if they want because now there will be an Id in the subject\nThe text below was posted in an online community called salesforce in the year 2021:\n\nI hope someone can point me in the right direction with this one. We currently have \\~8 email2case routings set up, 3 of which are used the most. We prefer that our customers log into their appropriate community and open their case from there because we have a lot of fields we want them to fill out besides just \"Subject\" and \"Description.\" This is how all customer cases should be created. From there, we use the email2case routing to communicate to the customer from the case comments until the case is resolved. After the case is created the customer can respond to us through email2case if they want, we just don't want the case to open this way. Most customers know this and follow this procedure, but we still have a lot of customers that will try to open a new case by sending an email to one of the email2case addresses. This is a huge headache because we have to manually fill in the information that we would have received if the customer followed our procedure and opened the case from the community instead.\n\nMy question: Is there a way to prevent a new case from opening if a customer sends a new email to an email2case address, then the system sends them a bounceback reminding them to please open the case through their community? To put it simply, a case should not be created if an email is sent to an email2case address that has no \"ref:\\_\" in the subject or body of the email. A bounceback should be sent instead with instructions on how to open a new case.\n\nI hope this is making sense lol.\n\nThe only thing I could think of is to create a before(or after?) trigger flow that looks for cases being created via email2case and if there is no \"ref:\\_\" in the \"Subject\" or \"Description\", the flow auto deletes the case and then sends an email alert to the customer instructing them to open new cases through the community. This solution seems messy so if anyone has any better ideas, I would really be thankful :)\n\nEDIT: So my flow (after trigger) isn't working. First, I created a formula checkbox that auto checks if the case was created via email2case. The formula field is working as intended. \n\nSo in my flow, the criteria is after the case is created and saved, and that formula field is checked, immediately delete the case.

But sadly, they were all autos. Anyway, has anyone gotten any hands on experience with these yet? I'm really interested in how much of a noticeable power difference there is after all the changes, specifically on the 2.0T.\n\nAlso, another question. I snagged a test-drive in a 2012 3.8 Track 6-speed while I was there, and all I could think was Holy. Shit.

I genuinely have *no idea* how I compare with other applicants and therefore I really don't know what type of schools I should be applying to. Here is a very overview of my application profile:\n\n* **Grades**: Non-flagship mostly unknown state school, \\~3.9 GPA (only A-'s in Systems-oriented courses and non CS\/math), but some extremely poor grades from high school and first year in non-CS courses at different school, double major math\/CS\n* **Research**: Year long funded math research (meh results, paper to be submitted to undergrad journal), Math REU at top 10 CS institution (worked with CS and math people, small paper will be submitted very soon), two years CS theory research (funded over summer, small possibility for paper, material for honors thesis)\n* **Letters of Rec:** One from each of my main advisers on my above projects, plus one from my Combinatorics\/Graph Theory professor who knows me fairly well for institutions that allow four recommendations.

The last 200 pages give or take, were some that will stick with me for a good while. I've been thinking about the series a lot as of recent, so I figured I should post about it just to chronicle some of my thoughts. \n\nGenerally speaking I know most on this sub have the same the same consensus about the Ka-Tet's death in the books so I'll skip over that part and go straight to the last two main points of the book. First off, I want to discuss Susannah's leaving. Of course it was different from the other's departing as they didn't leave voluntarily and she did. This is what struck a cord with me in terms of Susannah's character. The fact that she leaves out of really no where to Roland comes off as a bit of a selfish move. \n\nThat being said, I understand why she left. Her husband and ka-brother\/son were dead. She really had nothing to live for besides the support of Roland. Which ultimately wasn't a good reason to stay for her. I believe that her and Roland were really the most distant to eachother of the Ka-tet, if something like that is possible. Also to mention Oy, The Brave. I think he felt the same way, distant towards Roland and not really caring for him, but staying to honor the memory of Jake (and to save Roland's hide at the cost of his own). Overall I think the last interaction between Suze and Roland was depressingly realistic. \n\nLastly, there is that of actually reaching the tower and the whole \"cycle\". My own interpretation of the cycles is that they are Gan's punishment towards Roland. Roland was ultimately greedy, he didn't need to reach the tower but he lusted after it. Roland could have stopped after saving the Tower and went on with his life, but he didn't. Some may incur that he never does. In Arthurian legend, the protagonist is always punished for his flaw (ex. Sir Gawain). It only makes sense Roland be punished for his fatal flaw. I guess greedy isn't the right word to describe it, but Roland could have\/should have stopped after saving the beams, and I believe the cycles are his punishment for it. \n\nThat being said, I don't think he's being punished for his impeccable determination alone. I think his lack of compassion is also what sentenced him to his eternal hunt. This is of course where the horn comes in. He never really learned compassion for his either of his Ka-Tet until it was too late, until they were all gone. \n\nTo conclude, I'd like to hear some of other interpretations that many of you may have.

They were purchased by my-inlaws at a CVS store in Los Angeles. After a few days we opened them to use them.

When the consumer picks up one of these cards, goes to the register, puts money on it to load them without knowing that the bar code belongs to a card in possession of one of these scammers, so he's basically reloading someone else's gift card! Then they say the funds are not available for 24 hours, which is the time that the scammers need to clear the funds from the card corresponding to the fake bar code on the card. By the time the consumer finds out what has happened, the money has been cleared and he's left with nothing.

I wish I could go back and start from the beginning, but that would require me to go back to oh...2015 or 2016 with week to week updates...I'd never get caught up with current goings-on!  \n\n\nYou guys let me know if this is something you'll enjoy reading.  If so, I'll post week to week, if not, I wont :)  \n\n\nOne thing I'll warn you of is this: I'm no great fiction writer.

I've seen people do that with their game writeups and man it makes me jealous!  But I have no \"words\" for it, so you're stuck with a fairly ordinary blow-by-blow.  \n\n\nAnyway, without further ado...here we go:  \n\n\n \n\nHaving returned to the city of Greyhawk, the group scoured the city for useful items to assist them on their further adventures.  Etho traded his **ring of contrariness (ogre strength)** with the magical college of Greyhawk in exchange for a pair of spells.  Attempting to *write* them, he failed his first attempt and was injured.  The college, however, tended to his needs for a couple of days.\n\nOnce Etho was healed, he *identified* the three remaining potions, one of **longevity**, another of **water breathing** (two draughts in that vial), and the third and final unidentified potion was revealed to be a **potion of climbing.**  This took an additional couple days' work, so Etho took a well-deserved rest.\n\nNo additional magical inks were available in the city, so after a few days' sojourn, the party packed up, called the hired men back, and made their way to the Castle proper.  Encountering no dangers along the way, they set up camp in the area where they'd done so previously.  The stable created with the **lyre of building** courtesy of Rabindranath was still standing, and fortunately unoccupied.  Bronn beseeched Rabindranath to utilize the **lyre** again and create a longhouse for the men, as 30 men-at-arms and two animal handlers being sequestered in the **Daern's Instant Fortress** was a bit crowded.  Rabindranath acquiesced, and with a strum of the **lyre** a longhouse was created, providing ample space for resting, eating, and so forth for the hirelings.  \n\n\nEndorra, Kaine, and Fenorf elected to help the men-at-arms ready any defenses, since the growing number of structures in this wild area might prove a tempting target to evil forces, and told the party that they would make their way to them as soon as they were finished.  \n\n\nOnce they were squared away, the party ventured to the tower of sorcery and found their way to the elevator.  Grindle examined the usual display of pamphlets, this time, one depicting their encampment in flames, all the men at arms dead (with a caricature of Bronn hanging dead from a gibbet in the foreground) and a friendly message of \"Please - remember not to litter the grounds of Castle Greyhawk!\" beneath.  \n\n\nThey took the elevator-room down to the second level, moving north to a long gallery near an area they had previously explored, long ago.  At the western end there were two doors, one on the north side of the wall, and one on the south side.  A *find traps* spell revealed that the northern of the two had some mechanical trap, and Rabindranath stepped forward to disarm it, but failed.  The trap was sprung!  In less than a heartbeat the door snapped aside and a giant wooden mallet, with an 8' handle and 3' diameter wooden head sprang out of the alcove behind the door and smashed Rabindranath, inflicting 11 points of damage.  Looking in the 10x10x10 alcove behind the trap, Kaerliann could see that a fiendishly intricate gear mechanism took up most of the space.\n\nBrand Grayson cast *cure light wounds* on Rabindranath for a few points' healing, and the rest of the party searched the long chamber for secret doors.  While they did this, a metallic ratcheting sound came from the trapped alcove, and the hammer rotated up and withdrew, and the door slammed shut behind it.  Etho took his poinard and scratched \"TRAP\" with an arrow pointing at the door on the wall next to it.  \n\n\nContinuing through the southern of the two doors, the party entered a hallway that led to a previously (somewhat) explored mirror maze.  They weren't far along until Etho cried out in pain and pulled his tunic off, revealing that some force had carved the word FART into his chest, with an arrow pointing upward.\n\nClearly, Castle Greyhawk disliked his graffiti.  \n\nComporting themselves, the party used the right-hand method to search the maze more thoroughly than they had in prior explorations.  Other than a cold, clinging, oily mist around their ankles, and the distressing tendency of the mirrors to make them jump as they thought they were being ambushed, the party came to a dead end...\n\nIt was there that their mirrored images seemed to become real, before them.  The image of Brand Grayson stepped forward and spoke, saying \"Your faces will be ours.  Your lives, will be ours.\"  Brand tried to parlay, saying that they meant no harm here, but would not allow themselves to be duplicated or replaced.  This angered the forms, and they shrieked in near-unison and fell on the party.\n\nIn striking blows against them, it became clear that they were facing a force of Doppelgangers.  Petra smashed one of the mirrored walls, revealing a space beyond where the shape-changers had hidden before stepping out silently.  The destroyed mirror wall opened up the front and allowed most of those who could melee to do so.  The Doppelgangers fought with an eerie tenacity, their rubbery, fibrous skin absorbing hits.  Etho employed his **wand of frost** and blinded and blasted with cold their duplicates.  Within minutes of battle, it was all over.  The last three tried to flee, and two were cut down.  The final Doppelganger pleaded for its existence, shifting through forms of party members, those the party had known in the past, and other unknown beings.    \n\n\nBut the aliens had attacked with no quarter given, and the shape-changer would survive only to try to replace and usurp another, so it too at the last was dispatched.  \n\n\nExamining the Doppelgangers' lair-chamber, the party discovered a huge stash of coins, tens of thousands of silver, thousands of electrum, and many, many thousands of gold pieces.  Scrolls, curious items, jewelry, and a single gemstone were also located.  Clearly, the shapechangers had taken more than lives and identities over the ages.  Setting aside items for examination for magical properties, they began to formulate a plan to haul the nearly two and a half long tons of coins out of the dungeon.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': 'of2mrh', 'title': 'Into Castle Greyhawk.', 'author': 'BillTheDungeonDelver', 'subreddit': 'adnd', 'subreddit_id': '2vtpx', 'body': 'Note:  I thought I\\'d jump in here and start updating on my Monday night game which is nominally 11 players, plus of course the NPC **Type V** demoness, which y\\'all seemed to like reading about.

In less than a heartbeat the door snapped aside and a giant wooden mallet, with an 8\\' handle and 3\\' diameter wooden head sprang out of the alcove behind the door and smashed Rabindranath, inflicting 11 points of damage.  Looking in the 10x10x10 alcove behind the trap, Kaerliann could see that a fiendishly intricate gear mechanism took up most of the space.\\n\\nBrand Grayson cast *cure light wounds* on Rabindranath for a few points\\' healing, and the rest of the party searched the long chamber for secret doors.  While they did this, a metallic ratcheting sound came from the trapped alcove, and the hammer rotated up and withdrew, and the door slammed shut behind it.  Etho took his poinard and scratched \"TRAP\" with an arrow pointing at the door on the wall next to it.  \\n\\n\\nContinuing through the southern of the two doors, the party entered a hallway that led to a previously (somewhat) explored mirror maze.  They weren\\'t far along until Etho cried out in pain and pulled his tunic off, revealing that some force had carved the word FART into his chest, with an arrow pointing upward.\\n\\nClearly, Castle Greyhawk disliked his graffiti.  \\n\\nComporting themselves, the party used the right-hand method to search the maze more thoroughly than they had in prior explorations.  Other than a cold, clinging, oily mist around their ankles, and the distressing tendency of the mirrors to make them jump as they thought they were being ambushed, the party came to a dead end...\\n\\nIt was there that their mirrored images seemed to become real, before them.  The image of Brand Grayson stepped forward and spoke, saying \"Your faces will be ours.  Your lives, will be ours.\"  Brand tried to parlay, saying that they meant no harm here, but would not allow themselves to be duplicated or replaced.  This angered the forms, and they shrieked in near-unison and fell on the party.\\n\\nIn striking blows against them, it became clear that they were facing a force of Doppelgangers.  Petra smashed one of the mirrored walls, revealing a space beyond where the shape-changers had hidden before stepping out silently.  The destroyed mirror wall opened up the front and allowed most of those who could melee to do so.  The Doppelgangers fought with an eerie tenacity, their rubbery, fibrous skin absorbing hits.  Etho employed his **wand of frost** and blinded and blasted with cold their duplicates.  Within minutes of battle, it was all over.  The last three tried to flee, and two were cut down.  The final Doppelganger pleaded for its existence, shifting through forms of party members, those the party had known in the past, and other unknown beings.    \\n\\n\\nBut the aliens had attacked with no quarter given, and the shape-changer would survive only to try to replace and usurp another, so it too at the last was dispatched.  \\n\\n\\nExamining the Doppelgangers\\' lair-chamber, the party discovered a huge stash of coins, tens of thousands of silver, thousands of electrum, and many, many thousands of gold pieces.  Scrolls, curious items, jewelry, and a single gemstone were also located.  Clearly, the shapechangers had taken more than lives and identities over the ages.  Setting aside items for examination for magical properties, they began to formulate a plan to haul the nearly two and a half long tons of coins out of the dungeon.', 'body_is_trimmed': False, 'score': 30, 'over_18': False, 'num_comments': 6, 'created_utc': 1625601093}","check_char_repetition_criteria":0.0351694915,"check_flagged_words_criteria":0.0,"check_stop_word_ratio_criteria":0.4939467312}

Alas, there are genes with far more than just 4 alleles. In fact, there are genes with more than 1000 alleles (http:\/\/hla.alleles.org\/nomenclature\/stats.html).  Where did these come from?

An electronic toothbrush keeps your teeth, gums, and tongue cleaner and healthier**\n\nWeve been taught to brush our teeth thoroughly ever since we were little. Despite our best efforts, though, were not brushing as thoroughly as we would likethis is because the bristles on manual toothbrushes cannot reach to remove all of the plaque and tartar built up between your teeth.\n\nAn electric toothbrushs rotating head features bristles that can reach further thanks to the combination of motion and equal pressure from the brush itself.

My wife (38f) has almost completely lost sexual interest following her 2nd pregnancy (a bit over a year ago), and I just don't know what to do.\n\nHere is the current situation :\nWe have a 5mo old baby; my wife is breastfeeding and the baby wakes up 3-4 times a night. My wife has always been a bad sleeper, and she usually takes quite a long time to get back to sleep, which result in sheer exhaustion. I've witnessed first hand her total inability to focus or function normally most of the time. When she is not exhausted (which happens), she focuses on the many things she has to do that I just can't take care of for her, or just tries to relax (eg she loves gardening), and sex is the last thing on her mind. \n\nI do whatever I can to help. I'm taking care of our 2yo, of all the groceries, the laundry, cleaning around the house, most of the cooking etc. I just can't see anything more I could do. She actually told me many times that she appreciated me helping, and that she was very grateful, etc.\n\nThe pregnancy didn't go very well, she had very bad nausea, had a hard time finding a good position to sleep, etc, so sex was not really on her mind at the time either. We slept together maybe three times a month, always after I initiated, and it usually wasn't very satisfactory. At some point, I simply stopped initiating, and it stopped happening altogether. We had quite a few fights on the topic which didn't result in anything positive, as you would expect, so I just stopped fighting as well.\n\nA couple of months after our 2nd baby was born, we tried to have sex again, but she was just sleepy and not really into it, so we just haven't try again since then. I told her i knew she was exhausted, and that i didnt expect any sex until the baby was in daycare, at which time she should be able to get all the sleep she nerds during the day (3mo from now). Here I must say we are both working from home, that I'm making enough money to support the family and that she stopped working for now. \n\nBottom line, we had sex once this year, and this was 4 months ago. My wife doesn't masturbate, and seems to never be horny. Apparently it happened once over the past few months that she actually wanted to have sex but we had the kids around at the time so nothing happened. She also thought quite a few times that we maybe could have sex tonight, but for practical reason it just never happened. So there's no bad will on her part, just zero libido.\n\nBefore having kids, our sex life wasn't completely crazy but definitely healthy. We had sex several times a week, we were both orgasming most of the time (if not always), we even got a little kinky from time to time. Sex wasn't an area of concern whatsoever.\n\nMy wife thinks that it's just normal not to have any libido in her circumstances, and she doesn't doubt that it will slowly get back to normal over the course of a few years. She also said she appreciated me not being pushy or angry (which i am not) or worried (which i am)\n\nEventhough it's not very pleasant not to feel wanted at all, I'm fine with waiting a few more months. But I'm very worried we're never going to recover from this ... \n\nI should mention that after our first kid, things were quite different. I was definitely not picking my fair share of chores (for various reasons beyond the scope of this post), my wife wasn't as tired, and we had (good) sex maybe once a week. It's really the 2nd pregnancy that killed our sex life.\n\nAside from this elephant in the room, our relationship is going well on every other aspect, and my wife is showing some good will and some willingness to discuss and to work on the issue if it comes to that... (that is, when the sleep and the breastfeeding hurdles are behind us) \n\nI've talked to a handful of good friends (of both genders), and they're all betting their money on our sex life not improving. On reddit, men mostly think that she's probably cheating and that I should get a lawyer. I really don't think she is, and those men mostly seem to be very frustrated with their lives ...\n\nI'm looking for advice on what I could do to maximize the chances her libido will reappear in the future, and also for reassurance from women who have been in a similar situation and who now enjoy a healthy sex life with their partner.\n\nThank you all in advance !\nps: throwaway account for obvious reasons ...","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': 'cl6wew', 'title': 'Can libido ever reappear when it has completely disappeared after two kids?', 'author': 'brksslslepcjaaaaadhe', 'subreddit': 'AskWomenOver30', 'subreddit_id': '2ya5k', 'body': \"37m here.

{"id":"91799893","text":"Title: [OC] Aaron Rodgers NEEDS to throw more picks if the Packers want to win a Super Bowl\nThe text below was posted in an online community called nfl in the year 2019:\n\nIn 2010, Aaron Rodgers threw 11 picks. That same season, he led the Green Bay Packers to a Super Bowl championship. However, since that year, the Packers havent been back to the Super Bowl, let alone won the big game. Interestingly enough, he also hasnt thrown double digit interceptions since 2010 either. This **cannot** be a coincidence. Using my superior statistical analysis model, I have discovered that if Rodgers throws too few picks, his team will not succeed in the playoffs. \n\n\n**2011**\nIn the 2011 season, Rodgers broke the since season passer rating record with a PR of 122.5. He led the Packers to a 15-1 record and won MVP. However, following a first-round bye, the team was upset by the eventual SB champion New York Giants. Why? **Rodgers only threw 6 interceptions during the 2011 season.**\n\n\n**2012**\nIn 2012 the Green Bay Packers went 11-5 and won a wild card playoff game! However, the lost in the divisional round to the 49ers who went on to the Super Bowl that season. However, they DID win a playoff game, unlike the previous season, because Rodgers threw **8 interceptions.** More than last year, but still not into the double digits. \n\n\n**2013**\nRodgers was injured this season and only managed to play in 9 games, but he doesnt get a pass for that. He was only able to throw **6 interceptions** in 2013, meaning his team fell victim to a first-round exit, once again at the hands of the San Fran 49ers. \n\n\n**2014**\nA-Rod had a fantastic 2014 season. He won MVP while throwing for 4300 yards and 38 TDs, and led his team to a 12-4 record. However, Aaron and his team were in for a little playoff heartbreak. Despite making it to the NFC Championship game, the farthest the Packers had made it since winning the Super Bowl, the Seahawks recovered a late-game onside kick and eventually ended up stealing the game in OT with an insane Jermaine Kearse TD catch. The Packers blew a 16-0 lead in this game, but maybe if Rodgers had thrown more than **5 interceptions** during the regular season, they wouldve been headed to the Super Bowl. \n\n\n**2015**\nThis was the season of Aaron Rodgers Hail Mary heroics. An insane December throw in Detroit helped Rodgers propel his team to a 10-6 record with a wild card berth. Rodgers had a solid season, competing just over 60% of his passes with 31 TDs. The Packers were easily able to defeat the Redskins in a wild card game  35-18, but the divisional round matchup vs. the Cardinals is the game Im sure we all remember. The Packers were down 7 with less than 2 minutes to go at their own 4 yard line, needing a miracle. Luckily, Aaron Hail Mary Rodgers cane to the rescue. With two insane throws to Jeff Janis of 60 and 41 yards respectively, the Packers had tied the game up 20-20, sending it into overtime. Sadly, Larry Fitzgeralds magic was too much for the Packer defense to overcome, and Rodgers would never see the field again that season. Rodgers lofty total of **8 interceptions** was tied for his highest since winning the Super Bowl, which is how he was able to keep them in the game so long. However, if he had been able to reach double digits, maybe the Packers couldve moved on...\n\n\n**2016**\nIll admit, this season is a bit of an outlier in my A-Rod Interception Theory. With 6 games to go in the 2016, the Packers were in shambles: a 4-6 record with a 4 game losing streak. Luckily, magic Aaron bowed to Run the Table, and thats exactly what he did. The Packers ended up on a 6 game win streak, winning their division in the process with a 10-6 record. Rodgers threw 40 (!) touchdown passes and somehow led his team back to the NFC Championship game despite only throwing **7 picks**. However, in that game the Packers were obliterated by the Atlanta Falcons 44-21. Rodgers interception total was too low for the Falcons to even let the Packers THINK about making the Super Bowl this season. \n\n\n**2017**\nOnce again, Rodgers was injured this year. To be fair to Rodgers, we wont include this season as part of the data, since he only played in 7 games, less than half of a full NFL season, and his team missed the playoffs entirely. But for the record, Rodgers had only thrown **3 interceptions** before his injury (he threw 3 more in the only game he played after), so the Packers probably wouldnt have made any noise in the playoffs anyways. \n\n\n**2018**\nNow THIS is where all my research comes to fruition. Aaron Rodgers had a pretty subpar year by his standards, only throwing 25 touchdown passes, but the Green Bay Packers went an ASTONISHING 6-9-1, missing the playoffs for the first time this decade during a season when Rodgers played all 16 games! And theres a VERY clear reason why**AARON RODGERS ONLY THREW 2 INTERCEPTIONS DURING THE ENTIRE 2018 SEASON.** Astonishing! Rodgers shouldve known better than this if he really wanted to win a championship. \n\nAll in all, Id say my research is 100% accurate, with absolutely no flaws. Sorry Packers fans, but if yall wanna win another Super Bowl, Aaron Rodgers MUST channel his 11-pick 2010 self and finally reach that double-digit interception milestone again.

She needed an ADA room and she also needed for us to rent 2 mobility scooters. Upon check-in, I informed her that the room type they had booked only features one bed and the ADA King room was a bit smaller but had a wheelchair accessible bathroom.

I told her that it probably would not fit comfortably but we could try. So we wheel out the scooters, I leave it on \"turtle\" mode because OH is having some difficulties driving.

My folks helped a bunch with getting everything sorted - my mother is the guarantor for my place (I'm renting), and both her and my dad drove interstate to bring a ton of my furniture this weekend.\n\nThis morning Mum and I had a minor disagreement, resulting in her getting disproportionately upset.

That in and of itself is par for the course with them, but there's a bigger problem.\n\nMy mother owns a set of keys to my place, and before they left I requested that she return them. She was resistant and I clarified that I wasn't asking (it's my house and they're my keys). She refused, and left shortly after that.\n\n**What can I do?** I feel like this is fairly abusive behaviour - they live interstate so there's absolutely no reason for them to hold onto a set of keys.

That in and of itself is par for the course with them, but there's a bigger problem.\\n\\nMy mother owns a set of keys to my place, and before they left I requested that she return them. She was resistant and I clarified that I wasn't asking (it's my house and they're my keys). She refused, and left shortly after that.\\n\\n**What can I do?** I feel like this is fairly abusive behaviour - they live interstate so there's absolutely no reason for them to hold onto a set of keys. I don't like the thought of them showing up unannounced and being able to do whatever they want in the place. However, I'm mindful that I still need a guarantor, and I don't have anyone who'd be willing to act as one who isn't connected to my mother, so I'd be in a bit of trouble if she changed her mind. (I don't even know if guarantors *can* change their minds!)\", 'body_is_trimmed': False, 'score': 2, 'over_18': False, 'num_comments': 1, 'created_utc': 1497146495}","check_char_repetition_criteria":0.0292397661,"check_flagged_words_criteria":0.0,"check_stop_word_ratio_criteria":0.5633333333}

The event was small since he was only turning two and he didnt really have a preference of who will attend his birthday.   \nThus we invited our neighbours to join us for a small afternoon party. Long story short, it went great, without any stressful complications, aside from one. very. odd. occurrence.   \nMy son threw up a substantial amount of contents, which I will refrain from explicitly describing, on the table!   \n*Strange* I thought to myself observing as my wife went to the kitchen to grab a rag to clean up. What bothered me about that, however, was that as she was heading to the kitchen, she was giggling in an almost appraising manner, as if she was congratulating little Matty for the volume of well, you know   \n \n\nAfter the party, we set our little man to sleep in his crib, and began to clean around the house when I decided to tease my wife about what had happened earlier:  \n \n\nBabe, I think we might have been raising a little grizzly bear for the past two years and as I was saying that, I couldnt help but notice her smiling faintly, as if I had disclosed something embarrassing about myself.  \n \n\nWhy would you say that, Kev? she said while giggling, seemingly knowing why, yet wanting confirmation.\n\nSmirkingly and playfully, I confirmed her suspicions Our son went all out today and it wasnt pretty, yet you seemed to almost congratulate him for the generous amount of milk and puree that had just come out of him\n\nI know I said I wont describe the contents, but that is what I said\n\nThen, almost bursting into laugh but managing to calm herself, to almost a serious expression, she looked at me and said something that almost chilled me to the bone Kevin, you have no idea\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose words resonated in my head for the rest of the night, and kept me awake for a few hours after Nora had went to sleep.

Mathew had chewed off the wooden bars that stopped him from rolling out of his crib. What was even more disturbing was that it appeared he had eaten them, as they were nowhere to be found, and my wife assured me she hadnt touched them, while being completely chill and almost happy about what we had just witnessed.   \n \n\n*Where did he get the teeth to do that?*  I thought to myself while looking at him sitting on the floor smiling with his perfectly normal, baby looking teeth.  \n \n\nPanicked, I rushed baby-man to the ER only to be told after the screening that there seems to be absolutely nothing abnormal with my son  *he should have had wooden bars in his stomach, or whatever was left of them* I thought to myself. But no nada. It was as if they had vanished by some volatile powers.   \nThe only visibly odd thing was that his stomach was unusually bigger for what is considered normal but the doctor said it wouldnt be a problem, as he will outgrow it.  \n*WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WOULDNT BE A PROBLEM?!?!?!* I screamed in my head, while looking at the doctor as if he had spoken to me in another language  \nMattys stomach represented the size of my fist not his fist MY FIST!!! And I am not bragging, but I do have large hands, which makes this even worse.   \nI didn't wait for the doctor to keep on with his nonsense, so I picked Matty up and told Nora we are going home.  \n \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere hasnt been anything unusual about him ever since. I dont know what had happened that day, but the bars of the crib sure looked like they went through a storm of teeth. My wife acts as if nothing unusual had happened and that is starting to give me the creeps. Now we are teaching him to walk, and have bought a new crib, in hopes that nothing happens to it, or worse, to Matty.  \n \n\nI am sharing this here in hopes of advice on what to do.   \nHopefully nothing similar happens from here on out and I hope my son is alright.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': 'd9ylw7', 'title': 'I think there is something wrong with my family.', 'author': 'KevinBrook1', 'subreddit': 'nosleep', 'subreddit_id': '2rm4d', 'body': \"It was March 2017, a Wednesday late afternoon at 17:39.

What was even more disturbing was that it appeared he had eaten them, as they were nowhere to be found, and my wife assured me she hadnt touched them, while being completely chill and almost happy about what we had just witnessed.   \\n \\n\\n*Where did he get the teeth to do that?*  I thought to myself while looking at him sitting on the floor smiling with his perfectly normal, baby looking teeth.  \\n \\n\\nPanicked, I rushed baby-man to the ER only to be told after the screening that there seems to be absolutely nothing abnormal with my son  *he should have had wooden bars in his stomach, or whatever was left of them* I thought to myself. But no nada. It was as if they had vanished by some volatile powers.   \\nThe only visibly odd thing was that his stomach was unusually bigger for what is considered normal but the doctor said it wouldnt be a problem, as he will outgrow it.  \\n*WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WOULDNT BE A PROBLEM?!?!?!* I screamed in my head, while looking at the doctor as if he had spoken to me in another language  \\nMattys stomach represented the size of my fist not his fist MY FIST!!! And I am not bragging, but I do have large hands, which makes this even worse.   \\nI didn't wait for the doctor to keep on with his nonsense, so I picked Matty up and told Nora we are going home.  \\n \\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThere hasnt been anything unusual about him ever since. I dont know what had happened that day, but the bars of the crib sure looked like they went through a storm of teeth. My wife acts as if nothing unusual had happened and that is starting to give me the creeps. Now we are teaching him to walk, and have bought a new crib, in hopes that nothing happens to it, or worse, to Matty.  \\n \\n\\nI am sharing this here in hopes of advice on what to do.   \\nHopefully nothing similar happens from here on out and I hope my son is alright.\", 'body_is_trimmed': False, 'score': 19, 'over_18': False, 'num_comments': 3, 'created_utc': 1569581182}","check_char_repetition_criteria":0.1387453875,"check_flagged_words_criteria":0.0,"check_stop_word_ratio_criteria":0.5749440716}

These are questions Ive been wondering about, and I think its a good idea to start sharing ideas and potential solutions. Im starting with my thoughts and ideas, but if you have a better one I will happily update the post. If Ive got something wrong dont be afraid to point it out. The point here is to come up with answers and best practices for families and households that have a member working on the front lines.\n\n**My SO\/family member is a healthcare worker. Whats going to happen in the next couple of weeks?**\n\nCovid-19 cases are going to grow very quickly in the coming days and weeks. Healthcare workers are going to be called upon to work more as hospitals get more patients. Unless there is drastic action the hospitals will be overwhelmed in a very short time. Some healthcare workers may choose (or be required) to stay at the facility. They will be working extremely hard and may have little time to call\/email\/text. Dont take this personally.\n\n**Will my family member in healthcare get infected?**\n\nTheres no absolute answer to this. Hopefully they will have the training to use Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) correctly, and the facility will have adequate amounts of PPE. Even so, it should be assumed they will be exposed.\n\n**What about social\/physical isolation?**\n\nThis is complex. First, if you have a family member in healthcare, especially one who has direct contact with patients, it is vital that you practice social isolation strictly. There is no way to know if your family member has been exposed, and you exposed as a result. You should isolate as if others lives depend on it, because they do. If you have vulnerable family members in the household, limit their exposure as much as possible, move them to another relatives house or similar if possible.\n\n**What about social\/physical isolation if they come home every day?**\n\nAgain, it is VITAL that you strictly practice social distancing. Your family member may not be able to come home at some point, but that does not mean you can relax. You may already have been exposed today, its just going to become more likely as they (and you) have more exposure through their jobs.\n\n**How am I going to get food and medicines if we need it?**\n\nHopefully you have prepared and have adequate food and supplies for an extended home quarantine. If you do need more, try every avenue of getting it delivered. If you go out, you are putting others leslie24@example.net. Ask friends, neighbors, or relatives to bring food to you if necessary, but do not expose them to you or your house. Some pharmacies will deliver medications. How food and medicine is obtained\/delivered is going to evolve as isolation becomes more important and more enforced.\n\n**How can I help my family member prepare?**\n\nWhile your family member is still coming home, they will be exhausted. Sleep will be incredibly important for them, so find ways to maximize that time for them.\n\n* Have a couple of Go Bags for them with changes of clothes, medicines etc. so they can quickly and easily head out.\n* Have food prepared so that it is ready as quickly as possible when they come home  they may not have eaten for a while.\n* Dont expect them to help pick up the house, do dishes or other chores. Time doing that could be time sleeping, which is far more important for them right now.\n* Make it easy to charge or change batteries in devices (phone, pager etc). Start it as soon as possible when they get home  there is no guarantee they will be home very long.\n* Make sure you and your family members have 3 months of needed medications. This is extremely important. It may not be easy to get needed medications in the near future and we dont need our healthcare workers to suddenly run out of something they need to operate or survive.\n\n**What if I get sick?**\n\nThis is a possibility, for everybody. Think about how things will work at home if you are bedridden or need to be hospitalized. Plans for children, pets, etc will be vital. This will likely evolve as the situation evolves, but plan what you can now. For children  what needs to happen if neither my SO or I can take care of them? Is there a nearby low-risk relative or close friend they can go stay with if I get sick? Pets  the same applies.

It is meant to be that of a nice suggestion, with the hope the Epic would take it into consideration! As my boyfriend said, I have the tone of \"a cute, smiley girl\" so he read it as such, but text posts leave a lot of room for tone interpretation. Plus, I genuinely feel that Epic as a business will profit more if some of these changes were implemented. Thanks for your feedback, everyone!\n\n*Note #2:* Also, I'm aware that the connection between the Sunshine &amp; Rainbows back bling and my bigger topic of male\/female skins is a loose one. I can't modify the title after posting, unfortunately. I brought up both because the back bling is part of the bigger topic of gender inequality among the skins. This specific situation with the Brite Gunner is simply what inspired me to actually sit down and write the post, and that is why I brought it up specifically. Apologies for any confusion!\n\n\n-----\n\n\nTo start this off, I want to say that I'm not one to normally complain about game design nor gender inequality. Yet as an avid player of both PvE and PvP, I feel invested in Fortnite and have been recently let down with some of the gender inequality among the PvP skins and within the PvP store. With the recent release of the Brite Gunner and the Sunshine &amp; Rainbows back bling, I felt I had to say something, even if just on Reddit.\n\n\nFirstly, Epic has finally released the [Sunshine &amp; Rainbows back bling](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/fortnite-back-bling-brite-bag-768x629.jpg)! But there's a catch, it is only available on the new [Brite Gunner](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fortnite-outfit-brite-gunner-full.jpg), and was not released for the [Brite Bomber](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fortnite-outfit-brite-bomber-hd.jpg) skin owners. In my opinion, the back bling is very clearly meant to match the female skin; the Bomber skin has a llama and rainbow just like the back bling, while the Gunner has a teddy bear with guns. It honestly feels like Epic stuck a back bling that was meant to be released for the Brite Bomber onto the new male version of the skin. It feels like an attempt to make more money off of those players who already own the Brite Bomber skin.\n\n\nThis leads me to my bigger topic of discussion (which, I believe, could actually lead to more monetary profit for Epic in the long run).\n\n\nEpic, PLEASE start making the skins more equally split between male\/female. You should have a male &amp; female version of each skin. (Where is the female equivalent of the [Raven](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fortnite-outfit-raven-full.jpg) skin?) I will say that I have recently seen an increase in the number of skin themes with versions of both genders available. This is a step in the right direction. But there are still some inequalities that stand out to me.\n\n\n Both male &amp; female versions of a skin should either have a back bling, or should not. This would also require that both versions of the skin are the same rarity - a problem seen with the Sunshine &amp; Rainbows set. (See above.)\n\n Both male &amp; female versions of a skin should be available in the store at the same time. There is no worse feeling than when only the male or female skin version that I want is unavailable for another week, while its matching counterpart stares at me from the in-game store.\n\n Battle Pass skin unlocks should have an equal split between genders. The Season 3 Battle Pass had four male skins, but only two female skins. This is very frustrating! One possible solution could be that when a player unlocks a skin by tiering up in the battle pass, they should simply be able to choose one of the two skins - the male or female version.\n\n A matching counterpart to a Battle Pass skin should not be available only via purchase. A prime example of this is the [Dark Voyager](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fortnite-outfit-dark-voyager-hd.jpg) male skin (unlocked via Battle Pass) and the [Dark Vanguard](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fortnite-outfit-dark-vanguard-full.jpg) female skin (unlocked via purchase). That feels completely unfair to one gender. \n\n Some of the male\/female versions of one skin set are a bit too different. For example, the [Rex](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fortnite-outfit-rex.jpg) skin and [Tricera Ops](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fortnite-outfit-tricera-ops-full.jpg) skin are likely meant to complete a male\/female set. But they have a bit of a gap in their design. What if I want a cute Rex outfit on a female player model, so my green skin allows me to camp in bushes more easily? What if my male friend wants a bright red Tricera Ops male skin to catch other players' eyes and start more gunfights? I feel like a little bit of extra work to accommodate such designs on both male and female player models will make your player base much happier! Skin sets like that of [Hyperion](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/fortnite-outfit-hyperion.jpg) and [Dazzle](https:\/\/progameguides.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/fortnite-outfit-dazzle.jpg) are great examples of a male\/female complementing set that don't differ too much!\n\n Both male and female versions of a skin should be released at the same time. Rex was released much in advance of Tricera Ops. Dark Vanguard came out way after the Battle Pass and, therefore, Dark Voyager. \n\n\nWith the popularity of this game and the increase in the number of female gamers and streamers out there (like myself), please keep the female gamer audience in mind when designing! Thank you for the consideration, and we appreciate all the hard work Epic already puts into making Fortnite so great!\n\n\nTL;DR - Basically, Fortnite skins should have both male\/female versions. It would make the player base happier, would better include the growing number of female gamers, and could bring Epic more profit in the long run. I included details on thoughts of where the inequality lies, how to address the issues, and examples.\n\n\n-----\n\n\n*Edits:* Added links to Brite Gunner and Brite Bomber images.

After a few weeks of casual conversation and catching up we finally met up and had our first date. The date was fun and at the end of our date we made plans to see each other again. Since then we have been going on some pretty amazing and romantic dates, we had our first kiss, and he was the first to confess that he had some serious feelings for me which Ive reciprocated. \n\nWe agreed to take things slow\/as they come and everything has been really good. He makes me feel happy and most importantly I feel\/know that I can trust him. The only problem is that his ex-girlfriend (20f)  is still very much so in the picture. They broke up after she cheated on him and slept with another guy, but apparently since he is the only ex shes had that hasnt begged to have her back, shes become obsessed with him and trying to rekindle their relationship. Hes expressed that he has already moved on romantically from her. He wants to be friends with her since her family is overseas, but she has been making it impossible. \n\nShe calls and texts him over 100 times a day. If he doesnt answer her texts or calls hell put his phone on airplane mode and then shell start texting and messaging him over Instagram, Snapchat, ect. If he doesnt answer that she calls from a different phone number, calls his friends, calls his parents, and then drives to his house to wait for him since he ignored her calls. Sometimes hell answer her and tell her that hes busy but then she calls crying that hes ignoring her and has to spend time on the phone talking to her to calm her down. She has to know his exact location, who hes with, what hes doing, ect. He once made the mistake of mentioning that he was hanging out with me and then she texted that she was going to kill that bitch. \n\nMost recently after one of our dates he texted me because he was upset about an event that had happened to her. He sent me a screenshot where she (allegedly) had cut the whole length of her arm up and sent it to him in a Snapchat with the caption thanks because while we where together watching a movie, he didnt answer her messages.  She threatens suicide and wanting to kill herself and that if or when she does it, it will be his fault. Ive given him advice and tried to help him with his situation by advising that he contact her school or authorities for everything shes done, but Im not sure if he has done it yet, or if he will. He goes back and forth on blocking and unblocking her because he simultaneously feels bad since shes obviously off the rails and because he feels like hes obligated to help and be there for her. He explained that he has an overwhelming amount of anxiety when he has to see or meet with her, feels depressed, and explains that he would feel guilty if something happened to her. \n\nTheyve been broken up for almost a year now. \nIm not really sure what to do.

{"id":"126992063","text":"Title: Salary negotiation...unprofessional? Red Flag?\nThe text below was posted in an online community called KitchenConfidential in the year 2015:\n\nThanks for reading... I need some advice.\nToday was the last day of my 4 day stage at a restaurant I have wanted to join. After researching acceptable salary for area, and being prepared and rehearsed to negotiate...I walked in the restaurant and was immediately asked the salary I wanted. The Chef said yes, my number is doable. He had me grinding out recipes all day while handling my new station, which was fine because I am going to get paid what i deserve. At the end of the night I am approached by the owner who begins asking me a lot of personal questions about my recent health issues (why can you only work X hours?) asking me to explain them to others, and discusses my salary they want to offer IN FRONT OF 6 OTHER EMPLOYEES who are all listening and watching us. She says they can only do ( 3 dollars less pay) \nwith a raise in a month. I understand their strategy now...blindsiding me at the end of the day in an uncomfortable situation after I thought I was set with them... which was savvy on their part...but I don't think I want to work for these people now.

Rosemary bravely came out a few years with stories about how her father molested her as a child.  This caused a HUGE rift in the AUB church.  [Click here for link to story about that.](https:\/\/www.sltrib.com\/news\/polygamy\/2017\/10\/21\/sex-abuse-allegations-have-rocked-the-polygamous-church-of-sister-wives-causing-rift-from-utah-to-montana\/)\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'m wondering how, if at all, Mitch Thompson is related to the current prophet Lynn Thompson.

Now that the Crown of the Ivory King is the only DLC remaining I figured it would be a good time to *re-kindle* the discussion. Needless to say there may be some spoilers...\n\nMy theory stems from the name of a particular character mentioned only once in a ring that I'm sure we've all worn at some point in our quest across Drangleic. \n\n**Ring of Life Protection:** \n\n&gt;Divine ring that watches over one's life. Created by the students of **IVORY RHONES, SAGE OF LINDELT**. It's great protective power will protect you from any loss upon death, but after its power is spent, the ring will break. \n\n**Taken from the Dark Souls Wiki:**\n\n&gt;Lindelt is a sacred land that was ruled over by the Royal House of Osteria. The members of this noble family were the owners of the Ring of Restoration a protective ring passed down for generations amongst the members of the family. An ancient legend says that as long as the ring was held in the House of Osteria, the people of Lindelt would live in peace and safety.\n\n&gt;The kingdom of Lindelt was also the home to the Archdrake Sect, a religious cult known for their ancient rituals. The sect was also known for its knights who used powerful miracles during battle, a trait that made them worthy rivals to Drangleic's soldiers in their day.\n\n&gt;The sage Ivory Rhones, the warrior priest Forsalle and Licia are from here\n\nNo doubt exploring the location where such an incredibly powerful ring was developed would be important for the lore surrounding the undead curse. Now I'm wondering if Vendrick or Aldia would have seen these rings as useful in their research for curing the undead curse a ring capable of preventing the hollowing process should the bearer die, also allowing the bearer to retain their souls and thus their life essence. \n\n\n**Additional Item Descriptions:**\n\nReplenishment:\n\n&gt;An intermediate miracle. Gradually restores HP. (Slow health regeneration for 120 seconds.) This miracle is used by the resolute Lindelt cleric knights when fighting on the front lines.\n\nResplendent Life:\n\n&gt;A great miracle used by highly-ranked clerics. Slowly restores a large amount of HP. (Heals for 840 HP over 60 seconds.) Cleric Forsalle of Lindelt was a master of miracles who fought battles across the lands. His allies called him a holy knight, but his enemies feared him for his \"demonic powers\".\n\nArchdrake Robes \n\n&gt;Robes of the Archdrake sect of Lindelt. Little is known about the Archdrake sect and its ancient rituals, but it is said that their well-honed miracles and unwavering faith in the face of death made them worthy rivals to Drangleic's forces in their day.\n\nWhat are you guys thinking about the Ivory Crown DLC?","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': '2frecr', 'title': 'Ivory Crown Speculation', 'author': 'JGaymerGuy', 'subreddit': 'DarkSouls2', 'subreddit_id': '2vqni', 'body': 'I posted this a few months ago when it was confirmed that there would be three DLC packages each revolving around a particular crown and kingdom.

An ancient legend says that as long as the ring was held in the House of Osteria, the people of Lindelt would live in peace and safety.\\n\\n&gt;The kingdom of Lindelt was also the home to the Archdrake Sect, a religious cult known for their ancient rituals. The sect was also known for its knights who used powerful miracles during battle, a trait that made them worthy rivals to Drangleic\\'s soldiers in their day.\\n\\n&gt;The sage Ivory Rhones, the warrior priest Forsalle and Licia are from here\\n\\nNo doubt exploring the location where such an incredibly powerful ring was developed would be important for the lore surrounding the undead curse. Now I\\'m wondering if Vendrick or Aldia would have seen these rings as useful in their research for curing the undead curse a ring capable of preventing the hollowing process should the bearer die, also allowing the bearer to retain their souls and thus their life essence. \\n\\n\\n**Additional Item Descriptions:**\\n\\nReplenishment:\\n\\n&gt;An intermediate miracle. Gradually restores HP. (Slow health regeneration for 120 seconds.) This miracle is used by the resolute Lindelt cleric knights when fighting on the front lines.\\n\\nResplendent Life:\\n\\n&gt;A great miracle used by highly-ranked clerics. Slowly restores a large amount of HP. (Heals for 840 HP over 60 seconds.) Cleric Forsalle of Lindelt was a master of miracles who fought battles across the lands. His allies called him a holy knight, but his enemies feared him for his \"demonic powers\".\\n\\nArchdrake Robes \\n\\n&gt;Robes of the Archdrake sect of Lindelt. Little is known about the Archdrake sect and its ancient rituals, but it is said that their well-honed miracles and unwavering faith in the face of death made them worthy rivals to Drangleic\\'s forces in their day.\\n\\nWhat are you guys thinking about the Ivory Crown DLC?', 'body_is_trimmed': False, 'score': 30, 'over_18': False, 'num_comments': 33, 'created_utc': '1410133249'}","check_char_repetition_criteria":0.0411564626,"check_flagged_words_criteria":0.0,"check_stop_word_ratio_criteria":0.4582524272}

I live with my mother and her girlfriend. I have a job, my mom gets social security checks (she used to work from home but quit that job recently because she got into an argument with her boss) and mooches off family (when she borrows money from her sister I'm the one who has to drive to the store and get it, it's embarrassing), and her gf gets paid for taking care of my mom (she's legally blind and has lots of health problems so they found this at home caretaker thing online). I'm the only one with a car and a bank account. I have to drive them everywhere, do the shopping and they use my account for everything. She basically takes my entire paycheck and I have to ask her for money, remind her that I need gas, phone, etc. They both spend a lot of money on marijuana (about $1200 a month which is basically rent), rolling paper ($300 a month), and take out food ($500 a month). The only reason I know this is a made a budget for them, but it was like pulling teeth trying to get them to do the budget with me, they wouldn't tell me everything they spent money on, I just counted what I spent money on for them and what came out of my account. I eventually gave up on the budget because I was working with limited information and they refused to make any changes anyway. If she doesn't smoke she goes crazy and argues with her gf constantly and I have to hear it through thin walls, and I have no where to go when it happens. I have tried making suggestions for them to save money. They have expensive taste, if I find a cheaper no brand alternative of some product they refuse to try it. I have tried to put my foot down asked repeatedly over the years for them to just go over the finances and let me pay my fair share of the rent, so I can manage and have my own money and not have our finances pooled like this and they can do whatever the fuck they want with their income, and it's always the same excuses \"things are tight right now, etc\", at the time what she says makes sense and since I don't understand finances or anything adult related very well because I'm fucking retard and a pushover who cries easily and is afraid of confrontation and don't want to start ANOTHER argument that will last for hours so I just go along with it. They like to get high and talk about all these get rich quick schemes and I'm suck of hearing it, I just nod and say cool, I'd like to live my own life and let them do whatever the fuck they want and not get involved. I've been having lots of negative and casually suicidal thoughts lately, I cry a lot, live in a tiny bedroom, I feel socially stunted, I feel like a child, dating is impossible, my teeth are fucked up, I have student loan debt, I recently started seeing a therapist who was \"solution focused\" and I know it's my fault for complaining about my mom but all she wanted to do was talk about my mom and how to approach her about spending less money or gaining financial independence, none of it worked (it doesn't help the fact that I couldn't remember or explain very well what my therapist said to my mom or vice versa) and I had to quit therapy, I felt like I hit a wall and that $20 a week copay adds up. It doesn't help the fact that for years I treated my mom like my therapist and once I got the opportunity to see a real therapist I didn't know how to take advantage of it because I couldn't communicate my feelings to a complete stranger the way I do with my mom, despite the fact that she relies on my paycheck I rely on her for a lot of life advice, etc. I guess it's what you call a co-dependent relationship.

It gives us some essential character development for our future dark lord and I love the way the music complements hayden's acting in this scene.\n\nEpisode 3: Order 66. The montage of it being carried out across the galaxy was very emotional and incredibly well done IMO.\n\nRogue One: Darth Vader attacks. Just everything about this scene was perfect. It reminded us that Vader is one scary, badass villain while tying the film in nicely with Episode 4.\n\nEpisode 4: The trench run. The first time we see han solo return to save the day by knocking Vaders tie fighter off into space is such an amazing moment with real tension and it was the perfect finale for that film.\n\nEpisode 5: The dark side cave on dagobah. It perfectly encapsulates not only how flawed Luke is as a protagonist, but highlights the over arching theme of the series with us all having to acknowledge the dark side that lives in us, and why it's so important to defeat it.\n\nEpisode 6: Vader's Redemption. The way the music soars as Vader turns from his son and finally casts down the emperor is one of my favorite moments in cinema. An iconic end to an amazing character arc that is both heroic and gcalhoun@example.com.\n\nEpisode 7: The Return of Han Solo. The feeling you get when han and chewie come through that door and Han says \"we're home\" just gives me chills. Nuff said.\n\nEpisode 8: The throne room fight.

I put the term in quotation marks since it's not a very clear term, it can be used to refer to a variety of practices that were around during, \"feudal times\". Such times were home to more than just kings, lords, vassals, knights, and peasants. There were peasants who openly worked the land communally and largely independently. People occupied liminal spaces, regions had stark differences.\n\nContrary to popular belief there's no evidence that *prima nocte* or other similar policies were actually practiced. In general, these times weren't authoritarian, especially compared to what many are willing to tolerate today from modernist authorities. One of the worst crimes of Modernity was dismantling organic systems and replacing them with inorganic systems defined by authoritarianism.

They all had a degree of autonomy that kings not only respected but mostly had no choice but to respect. The king himself belonged to or had relatives who belonged to several of these categories. Each of these groupings had their own rhythm, their own way of looking at the world, their own inner-culture, their own contribution to social unity and peace.

We were acquaintances for the first year but now we are very close friends. We joke, have fun, and have great conversations whenever we are together. We have so many inside jokes its hard to keep track.\n\nI have developed a crush on him, but he has a serious girlfriend who he has been with for three-ish years.\n\nIve made a list of some of the things that make me think he has a crush on me:\n\n1.

Will come visit me in my department multiple times a day.\n\n3. We text daily at all hours of the day.\n\n4. Will occasionally call me in the evenings just to talk.\n\n5. Will save me a seat during meetings at work\/always sits next to me.\n\n6. Finds reasons to come see me even when its not necessary (to borrow stapler, tape, etc).\n\n7. Buys me birthday presents and Christmas presents.\n\n8. Comes and grabs me when its lunch break.\n\n9. Leaves me funny harrisrobert@example.com.\n\n10. Other coworkers have made comments on how close we are.\n\n11. Caught him checking me out twice.\n\n12. His girlfriend randomly added me on Facebook one night (I never talk to her and met her once over a year ago).\n\nAre these signs of a crush?

{"id":"61436555","text":"Title: [Misc]Rude Awakening (Destiny fanfic, wall of text)\nThe text below was posted in an online community called DestinyTheGame in the year 2015:\n\nTitan Training Log, Entry 1\n\nToday is a big day. A huge day. \n\nI'm a Titan, but I haven't been one for very long. It feels like only yesterday that my ghost found me in the ruins of the Cosmodrome. He brought me back to life, led me through the wall, and brought me to the Tower. \n\nI remember nothing of my old life. If I was ever in heaven or hell, I don't remember it. All I know is what is happening now: the Darkness is approaching, and I have to help fight it. \n\nI'm human. I say that because there are a lot of non-humans running around the tower. There are the Exos, the humanoid robots who were supposedly the pinnnacle of technology in the Golden Age. And there are the Awoken, who look human, but are somehow just...not. \n\nAs a Titan, I paid my dues. I patrolled every chance I could and took every bounty I could get my hands on. Whenever a mission came up, I volunteered. Whenever Commander Zavala held training, I was the first to arrive and the last to leave. \n\nIt was hard work, but today it paid off. Because today, I was finally selected for a Nightfall team. \n\nThere are many strong Guardians in the Tower, but the Nightfalls stand out. It's not just the orbs of dark energy floating around their heads; even if there was no outward sign, you would know. They're just different. They've conquered some of the toughest challenges the Darkness can throw at them, and they've come back, again and again. \n\nThese are the top of the top. They're the best. The Nightfall Guardians are the ones who become Raiders. Since I've gotten to the tower, all I've ever wanted was to become a Nightfall Guardian. \n\nAnd today is my chance. \n\nThe Commander called us into the Hall of Guardians and explained what would happen. Beneath the ruins of the Cosmodrome, he began, in the shadow of an old colony ship, we've located the House of Devils' lair, and the High Servitor feeding them their strength. Our task: to infiltrate the Lair and take down Sepiks Prime, the Devils' servitor. \n\nMy teammates are an Exo Voidwalker named Reaver-7 and an Awoken Gunslinger named Ramona. Reaver doesn't talk much, but he's both powerful an experienced. Ramona is one of the deadliest shots in the Tower, revered for her marksmanship even by other Hunters. \n\nIt's almost time for us to leave. I should be scared, but I'm not. I trust my teammates to keep me alive and I trust my ghost to get me back to orbit before the Darkness consumes us. I just hope I can keep up with Reaver and Ramona. They didn'tt say it, but I could tell when they looked at me that they felt they would have to carry me through the strike. \n\nI don't want to be carried. I want to fight. \n\n\nEntry 2\n\nJust returned from the Nightfall. It was incredible. \n\nAt the beginning, Reaver took me aside and said, don't worry about anything. Just stick with me and you'll be fine. And then he flew off on his sparrow, leaving us to chase in his wake. \n\nRamona was amazing. I had heard stories about her, but it's something else to actually see her in action. In our very first firefight, she took out two Fallen Captains and a Hive Wizard with her Golden Gun. She never missed. I started to think that she could fight blindfolded. \n\nReaver was even better. He had a strange sixth sense about him, like he knew exactly where the enemy would come from. We fought a giant walker, and he didn't flinch; he just led us to a sniper hide, one he must have scouted dozens of times, and calmly directed our fire while we took the massive tank down. \n\nI was no slouch. Reaver told me to concentrate on the Dregs and Vandals while he and Ramona took out the bigger targets, and I followed my orders to the letter. I took out dozens of the ugly bastards, and claimed three Vandal heads. \n\nWe fought Sepiks in a sort of dry dock that was teeming with Fallen foot soldiers. They attacked us in wave after wave, but each time we fought through them and hit the Servitor right in his singular eye. Reaver, sensing our enemy was weak, jumped up and unleashed a spectacular Nova Bomb that vaporized Sepiks and sent his minions running for cover. \n\nBefore we returned to orbit, Ramona clapped a hand on my shoulder and said, not bad, kid. It was the greatest compliment I've ever received. I looked to Reaver, but he said nothing. He just pulled out his ghost and disappeared. \n\nI'm back in my room now in the Tower, and I feel different. The Nightfall really does change you, and it's not just the dark energy coursing through you and the orbs floating around your head. I know now that I can tackle any challenge the Darkness puts before me. \n\nI am a Nightfall Guardian. \n\n\nEntry 3\n\nMy career has really begun to take off. I've gone on two more Nightfalls; one to destroy a Hive abomination named Phogoth deep in the catacombs of the moon, and one to destroy Sekrion, a Vex mind on Venus. Both times, Reaver and Ramona were my teammates; the Vanguards feel we work well together. Cayde said that if we keep this up, we'll be linked with another fire team to form a raid group. I can't wait. \n\nRamona was thrilled by that  news. Reaver didn't say anything. I know Exos are robots, but he seems cold and emotionless, even for a machine. Being part of a raid team is the ultimate honor a Guardian can receive. He could at least get a little excited about it. \n\nI don't care, though. Reaver may barely acknowledge my existence, but he's a great fighter. I feel, in a small way, that our fireteam is really helping to push back against the Darkness. \n\n\nEntry 4\n\nSomething is wrong. Something is very, very wrong. \n\nOur fireteam was once again selected for a Nightfall. Again, Zavala would be spearheading the effort. We went to the Hall of Guardians, where the Commander laid out his plan. \n\nBeneath the ruins of the Cosmodrome, he began, in the shadow of an old colony ship, we've located the House of Devils' lair, and the High Servitor feeding them their strength. \n\nI froze. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. \n\nThe Commander went on to describe how we were to infiltrate the Lair and take down a servitor named Sepiks Prime. Next to me, Ramona furiously scribbled notes. \n\nAny questions? Zavala asked when he finished his brief. \n\nI gulped. Sir, I began, we already... somehow, I couldn't find the words. \n\nZavala just ihall@example.com. What is it, Guardian? he asked impatiently. \n\nI tried talking again, but then I noticed Reaver. He was staring at me, with a look that felt like it bored through my eyes to the back of my skull. Its message was clear: shut up. \n\nNothing, sir, I said, returning my attention to the Commander. I'm ready. \n\nGood, Zavala replied. The three of you, get going. \n\n\nEntry 5\n\nJust  returned from the Nightfall. It was like a nightmare. \n\nWe finished the strike. That wasn't a problem. The issue was the fact that Fallen soldiers my team and I had already killed were back. The same Captains that Ramona had killed were back. As was the Devil Walker. As was every Dreg and Vandal I killed. \n\nThese Fallen weren't just like the ones we had killed  the first time through; they were the same ones. Somehow, I could just tell. \n\nFighting Sepiks confirmed it. I had watched Sepiks explode before my own eyes, and I know that no two High Servitors are exactly alike. And yet, there he was. Not a clone, not another Servitor, but Sepiks himself. And again, I watched Reaver kill him with a Nova Bomb. \n\nWhen the mission was over, Ramona again clapped me on the shoulder and said, not bad, kid. I barely heard her. \n\nThis time, however, Reaver was ihall@example.com. Right through me. I felt icewater run through my veins. \n\nI don't know what-wait. There's a knock at my door. I'll finish this when I get back. \n\n\nEntry 6\n\nThat was Reaver. And I was right. \n\nWhen I opened the door, he stared at me for a few seconds, then walked by me without saying a word. I closed the door and followed him. \n\nHe went to the middle of my small room, then turned around and ihall@example.com. \n\nDo you trust your ghost? he said. \n\nBefore I could answer, my ghost popped out and flew up to his face. \n\nWhat kind of question is that? my ghost said. I'm his ghost! I... but he too grew quiet under Reaver's withering gaze. \n\nWhat I am going to say, Reaver began, you are not to repeat to anyone, not even Ramona. That was the one hundred and thirteenth time I have done that strike. \n\nMy knees began to buckle. I grabbed a nearby chair for support. \n\nHow... I stammered, how is that possible? \n\nI don't know yet, he continued. But you saw it for yourself. It's all the same. All the enemies. The terrain. Sepiks. Everything we did on your first Nightfall, we repeated this time. He took a few steps closer to me and looked me in the eye. What I find interesting is that you noticed. Most humans don't.

A huge day. \\n\\nI'm a Titan, but I haven't been one for very long. It feels like only yesterday that my ghost found me in the ruins of the Cosmodrome. He brought me back to life, led me through the wall, and brought me to the Tower. \\n\\nI remember nothing of my old life. If I was ever in heaven or hell, I don't remember it. All I know is what is happening now: the Darkness is approaching, and I have to help fight it. \\n\\nI'm human. I say that because there are a lot of non-humans running around the tower. There are the Exos, the humanoid robots who were supposedly the pinnnacle of technology in the Golden Age. And there are the Awoken, who look human, but are somehow just...not. \\n\\nAs a Titan, I paid my dues. I patrolled every chance I could and took every bounty I could get my hands on. Whenever a mission came up, I volunteered. Whenever Commander Zavala held training, I was the first to arrive and the last to leave. \\n\\nIt was hard work, but today it paid off. Because today, I was finally selected for a Nightfall team. \\n\\nThere are many strong Guardians in the Tower, but the Nightfalls stand out. It's not just the orbs of dark energy floating around their heads; even if there was no outward sign, you would know. They're just different. They've conquered some of the toughest challenges the Darkness can throw at them, and they've come back, again and again. \\n\\nThese are the top of the top. They're the best. The Nightfall Guardians are the ones who become Raiders. Since I've gotten to the tower, all I've ever wanted was to become a Nightfall Guardian. \\n\\nAnd today is my chance. \\n\\nThe Commander called us into the Hall of Guardians and explained what would happen. Beneath the ruins of the Cosmodrome, he began, in the shadow of an old colony ship, we've located the House of Devils' lair, and the High Servitor feeding them their strength. Our task: to infiltrate the Lair and take down Sepiks Prime, the Devils' servitor. \\n\\nMy teammates are an Exo Voidwalker named Reaver-7 and an Awoken Gunslinger named Ramona. Reaver doesn't talk much, but he's both powerful an experienced. Ramona is one of the deadliest shots in the Tower, revered for her marksmanship even by other Hunters. \\n\\nIt's almost time for us to leave. I should be scared, but I'm not. I trust my teammates to keep me alive and I trust my ghost to get me back to orbit before the Darkness consumes us. I just hope I can keep up with Reaver and Ramona. They didn'tt say it, but I could tell when they looked at me that they felt they would have to carry me through the strike. \\n\\nI don't want to be carried. I want to fight. \\n\\n\\nEntry 2\\n\\nJust returned from the Nightfall. It was incredible. \\n\\nAt the beginning, Reaver took me aside and said, don't worry about anything. Just stick with me and you'll be fine. And then he flew off on his sparrow, leaving us to chase in his wake. \\n\\nRamona was amazing. I had heard stories about her, but it's something else to actually see her in action. In our very first firefight, she took out two Fallen Captains and a Hive Wizard with her Golden Gun. She never missed. I started to think that she could fight blindfolded. \\n\\nReaver was even better. He had a strange sixth sense about him, like he knew exactly where the enemy would come from. We fought a giant walker, and he didn't flinch; he just led us to a sniper hide, one he must have scouted dozens of times, and calmly directed our fire while we took the massive tank down. \\n\\nI was no slouch. Reaver told me to concentrate on the Dregs and Vandals while he and Ramona took out the bigger targets, and I followed my orders to the letter. I took out dozens of the ugly bastards, and claimed three Vandal heads. \\n\\nWe fought Sepiks in a sort of dry dock that was teeming with Fallen foot soldiers. They attacked us in wave after wave, but each time we fought through them and hit the Servitor right in his singular eye. Reaver, sensing our enemy was weak, jumped up and unleashed a spectacular Nova Bomb that vaporized Sepiks and sent his minions running for cover. \\n\\nBefore we returned to orbit, Ramona clapped a hand on my shoulder and said, not bad, kid. It was the greatest compliment I've ever received. I looked to Reaver, but he said nothing. He just pulled out his ghost and disappeared. \\n\\nI'm back in my room now in the Tower, and I feel different. The Nightfall really does change you, and it's not just the dark energy coursing through you and the orbs floating around your head. I know now that I can tackle any challenge the Darkness puts before me. \\n\\nI am a Nightfall Guardian. \\n\\n\\nEntry 3\\n\\nMy career has really begun to take off. I've gone on two more Nightfalls; one to destroy a Hive abomination named Phogoth deep in the catacombs of the moon, and one to destroy Sekrion, a Vex mind on Venus. Both times, Reaver and Ramona were my teammates; the Vanguards feel we work well together. Cayde said that if we keep this up, we'll be linked with another fire team to form a raid group. I can't wait. \\n\\nRamona was thrilled by that  news. Reaver didn't say anything. I know Exos are robots, but he seems cold and emotionless, even for a machine. Being part of a raid team is the ultimate honor a Guardian can receive. He could at least get a little excited about it. \\n\\nI don't care, though. Reaver may barely acknowledge my existence, but he's a great fighter. I feel, in a small way, that our fireteam is really helping to push back against the Darkness. \\n\\n\\nEntry 4\\n\\nSomething is wrong. Something is very, very wrong. \\n\\nOur fireteam was once again selected for a Nightfall. Again, Zavala would be spearheading the effort. We went to the Hall of Guardians, where the Commander laid out his plan. \\n\\nBeneath the ruins of the Cosmodrome, he began, in the shadow of an old colony ship, we've located the House of Devils' lair, and the High Servitor feeding them their strength. \\n\\nI froze. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. \\n\\nThe Commander went on to describe how we were to infiltrate the Lair and take down a servitor named Sepiks Prime. Next to me, Ramona furiously scribbled notes. \\n\\nAny questions? Zavala asked when he finished his brief. \\n\\nI gulped. Sir, I began, we already... somehow, I couldn't find the words. \\n\\nZavala just stared at me. What is it, Guardian? he asked impatiently. \\n\\nI tried talking again, but then I noticed Reaver. He was staring at me, with a look that felt like it bored through my eyes to the back of my skull. Its message was clear: shut up. \\n\\nNothing, sir, I said, returning my attention to the Commander. I'm ready. \\n\\nGood, Zavala replied. The three of you, get going. \\n\\n\\nEntry 5\\n\\nJust  returned from the Nightfall. It was like a nightmare. \\n\\nWe finished the strike. That wasn't a problem. The issue was the fact that Fallen soldiers my team and I had already killed were back. The same Captains that Ramona had killed were back. As was the Devil Walker. As was every Dreg and Vandal I killed. \\n\\nThese Fallen weren't just like the ones we had killed  the first time through; they were the same ones. Somehow, I could just tell. \\n\\nFighting Sepiks confirmed it. I had watched Sepiks explode before my own eyes, and I know that no two High Servitors are exactly alike. And yet, there he was. Not a clone, not another Servitor, but Sepiks himself. And again, I watched Reaver kill him with a Nova Bomb. \\n\\nWhen the mission was over, Ramona again clapped me on the shoulder and said, not bad, kid. I barely heard her. \\n\\nThis time, however, Reaver was looking at me. Right through me. I felt icewater run through my veins. \\n\\nI don't know what-wait. There's a knock at my door. I'll finish this when I get back. \\n\\n\\nEntry 6\\n\\nThat was Reaver. And I was right. \\n\\nWhen I opened the door, he stared at me for a few seconds, then walked by me without saying a word. I closed the door and followed him. \\n\\nHe went to the middle of my small room, then turned around and looked at me. \\n\\nDo you trust your ghost? he said. \\n\\nBefore I could answer, my ghost popped out and flew up to his face. \\n\\nWhat kind of question is that? my ghost said. I'm his ghost! I... but he too grew quiet under Reaver's withering gaze. \\n\\nWhat I am going to say, Reaver began, you are not to repeat to anyone, not even Ramona. That was the one hundred and thirteenth time I have done that strike. \\n\\nMy knees began to buckle. I grabbed a nearby chair for support. \\n\\nHow... I stammered, how is that possible? \\n\\nI don't know yet, he continued. But you saw it for yourself. It's all the same. All the enemies. The terrain. Sepiks. Everything we did on your first Nightfall, we repeated this time. He took a few steps closer to me and looked me in the eye. What I find interesting is that you noticed. Most humans don't. Some Awoken do. But its mostly Exos who see it, even after their minds get wiped. \\n\\nI began to breathe hard. Does Ramona know? \\n\\nIf she does, she doesn't show it. But you can never be sure with Hunters. \\n\\nI walked away and sat down on my little armchair. But who could be doing this? Then, I sat bolt upright. This is a time loop. It can only be the Vex. \\n\\nIt isn't the Vex, Reaver said. The only place they could do something like this is the Vault of Glass. Their power doesn't extend to Earth. \\n\\nBut then...the Darkness? Or is it the... I clapped my right hand over my mouth, realizing I almost said Traveler. \\n\\nThat's my thinking, he said, guessing at my thoughts. \\n\\nBut why?\\n\\nI have no idea. But this war we think we're fighting...all we're doing is spinning our wheels. We're not beating back the Darkness. We don't know what the Darkness is. All we're doing is going on the same missions over and over again, killing the same enemies over and over again.

Or who at least  has an idea of what's really happening. \\n\\nWho? \\n\\nFor the first time, I saw him smile, in that strange Exo way. Don't be so dense. \\n\\nIt took me a moment  to figure out that he meant the Speaker. \\n\\nFrom now on, he continued, be very careful about what you say and who you talk to. He headed for the door. I'll see you at the next mission brief. \\n\\n\\nEntry 7\\n\\nJust came back from the Nightfall brief. Again, we're being sent against Sepiks Prime. \\n\\nRamona seemed unfazed. Reaver and I, we just looked at each other and then proceeded to get ready for our mission. \\n\\nTo be continued...\", 'body_is_trimmed': False, 'score': 3, 'over_18': False, 'num_comments': 2, 'created_utc': '1424041590'}","check_char_repetition_criteria":0.0337901258,"check_flagged_words_criteria":0.0,"check_stop_word_ratio_criteria":0.5459032577}

{"id":"147051460","text":"Title: Analysis of New Jungle Item Income\nThe text below was posted in an online community called leagueoflegends in the year 2013:\n\nI have spent a little time doing some analysis of how the new jungle items will change gold income for junglers.  A bit of a preface, tests were done on the live server while pbe has other changes (new camp, slightly different gold values for monsters) which will cause some differences.  Here's an item by item breakdown.\n\n**Wriggle's Latern**\n\nWriggle's on PBE increases gold rewards from jungle creeps by 40%, has attack speed instead of AD and is a bit cheaper.\n\nI tested Tryndamere on live using current wriggles. PBE wriggle's would probably speed his clearing a bit which combined with the additional camp would likely skew these results more towards the extreme (that is a larger overall percentage gold increase). That said the test was just hardcore farming whereas in a real game you might actually wish to gank at some point.\n\nJust farming jungle creeps I expect you can get the new wriggle's at around 8:30 game time.  From 8:30 to 20:00 I gained 3540 gold. Approximately 1260 of that gold was from ambient gold gain. Thus 2280 (3540-1260) from jungle creeps. New wriggle's would increase this by 40% for an increase of 912 gold or 1.3 gold a second. \n\n**Spirit of the Ancient Golem**\n\nSpirit of the Ancient Golem on PBE has \"Conservation\". A passive which grants up to 30 extra gold when killing a large or epic monster based on the last time it was used.  \n\nReportedly you get a stack of conservation every 1.5 seconds and cash in your stacks at the rate of 1 gold a piece when you kill a large or epic monster. Thus obviously the maximum rate of income generation from the passive is 30\/1.5 stacking time*30 stacks or .66 gold per second. Obviously this is far less than what is possible from wriggle's but frees up the jungler to do something other than farm without drastically reducing income.\n\n**Spirit of the Elder Lizard and Spectral Wraith**\n\nThese items gained \"Bounty Hunter\". Champion kills, assists and epic monsters gain a bonus 30 gold while large monsters grant 10 bonus gold.  \n\nThe champion kills and assists portion of this passive depends wildly on gank success so I'm going to ignore it, but keep in mind it's still there. I'm also going to assume you're donating one of your buffs each cycle. This leaves 4 large monsters a minute and 1 epic monster in your jungle every 5 minutes.  Gains then come to 40 gold per minute from large monsters and 6 gold a minute (30 gold\/5 minute spawn time) from epic monsters or 46 gold a minute or .76 gold per second. Additional value not included in this calculation includes bonus gold from dragon, baron and champion kills\/assists. \n\nNotably this increase in gold income is greater than that gained from Conservation but requires killing 4 camps a minute which is essentially full time farming. You could attempt to make a case that this passive could be worth more if you counter jungled and thus had access to more camps.  However, in my opinion while you could deny camps to your opponent you're unlikely to actually be able to clear more than 4 camps quickly enough to improve the gold gains calculated here. \n\nTo stem any \"but but but\" sort of remarks. I'm making no claim to the quality of the items, only showing some math regarding the amount of income they CAN provide.  Not will provide, can provide :P\n\n**TLDR: Wriggle's can give approximately 1.3 gold per second while hardcore farming. Ancient Golem can give .66 gold per second while allowing time for ganks.  Elder lizard and spectral wraith give .76 gold per second while hardcore farming.**\n\nSorry if there are any errors!","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': '1ppg4l', 'title': 'Analysis of New Jungle Item Income', 'author': 'Joat116', 'subreddit': 'leagueoflegends', 'subreddit_id': '2rfxx', 'body': 'I have spent a little time doing some analysis of how the new jungle items will change gold income for junglers.

{"id":"166460869","text":"Title: Reddit, I'm in need of some advice and differing opinions here. I feel like I'm going to make a stupid decision regarding 15 year relationship with my wife. Am I blowing this out of proportion?\nThe text below was posted in an online community called relationship_advice in the year 2014:\n\nSo, lets begin. \n\nMy wife and I have been together for a long time. Since way back in high school. We have had our ups and downs, as kids do during our early years but nothing too major. We have always been there for each other and we work really well together.\n\nRecently the wife has been going through some changes. They were not all bad but she is the type to find something new she likes and then take it to the extreme. Overall she has become more fun and outgoing and also more sexually active which is awesome. These are attributes that she has always suppressed for one reason or another. At this point she has gone all out crazy with these new features as if she is making up for lost time. Lastly, she now loves drinking which is something I have been trying to get her into for a long time. All of these new things mixed together have made her very flirty especially when drunk. We have talked about this flirty-ness and I dont mind it as long as it doesnt develop into anything else.\n\nAbout 4 months ago she started going to the gym and she was toning up. She also joined Reddit after finding r\/ladyboners. This subreddit and others like it piqued her interest in Reddit and she became hooked. Her new found confidence from the gym made her want to post. I was all about it as I knew it would this would help her self-esteem. I even prepared her for the inevitable influx of hotdogs in her inbox. My only condition was that she didnt engage in long term communication with these dudes. She could comment and talk but no texting or continued contact with the same people.\n\nNow that I feel the stage is set, I will start with the unnerving changes I witnessed. She started disconnecting from the family. We have kids and she seems to not want to be bothered by them anymore. She also started to live on her phone. She was always texting and always private about what happened on her phone. Her phone was now locked when it never was before. All of these things we obvious but I ignored telling myself I was being paranoid. One night I was out drinking and thinking about the situation. I came home and she was sleeping. I went to work to get into her phone. After successfully getting in, I found the reason for all my suspicions. She had been communicating with some regulars from Reddit in very intimate fashion. She was sexting with nude selfies and communicating via other mediums as well. I also found hundreds of intimate selfies on her phone including videos of explicit acts saying the name of her reddit partner. At this time she woke up and saw what I was doing. She knew she was caught and I told her that I was going to continue looking at her phone. There was so much evidence in the way of online and remote intimate communications. I have no proof nor do I suspect that she was meeting anyone or cheating in a physical sense. The biggest hit to me here was the lying and sneaking. Also, the fact that I saw what was going on and ignored it.\n\nWe had a loooong talk that night. She admitted she was wrong and she got sooo carried away. She explained that it made her feel great and she was wrapped up in it. I voiced all my concerns and told her that my trust was broken at this point. I left some details of the convo out to shorten this story a bit. Fifteen years is a long time to throw away when a meaningful conversation can be had afterwards and all issues can be addressed. We decided to move forward and work on the trust. I had her email and text the people she was talking to and let them know it was over. She then deleted her Reddit account and the contact info on her phone. She also unlocked her phone moving forward and invited me to look through it at my leisure.\n\nSkipping forward a month or so, things have gone back to normal. She is still flirty with people especially when she drinks but it is all within line. Im not against flirting as I like to do it myself within reason. We have a party at our house and all is well. We find out that my friends wife is mad at my friend and she wont talk to anyone about it. My wife is very concerned but I tell her not to worry about it. She wont let go that its her fault. Two days later the wife tells me that she has to tell me something. My best friend sent my wife a dick pic the night of the party. They conspired not to tell anyone about it. My wife told me but only after the situation blew up and my friends wife caught wind of the situation. I cant help but think that I would not have found out if my friend wasnt caught. Whats messed up about this is that I blame both my wife and my friend. My friend obviously didnt have a gun to his head when he sent the pic. On the other hand, how much was my wife flirting to make him think it was a good idea? Im mainly mad that my wife didnt report this right away. She protected my friend and in doing so broke my already shaky trust.\n\nIm fuming mad right now and I dont know if I should go with my gut to flip shit or work for a resolution.\n\nEdit: For the record I dont know if the dick pic was solicited on her stevetaylor@example.com. She could be innocent on that front. She did however decide to cover it up either out of malice or because she was afraid of this information being released in light of our recent issue. If she had told me he did that from the begining this wouldn't be an issue.\n\n\nTL;DR: My wife has had a mid(ish)life (30 years old) crisis and changed some big parts of her personality. These changes have continued to negatively impact myself and our family as a whole. My question is whether I am blowing this out of proportion.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': '2a8uv8', 'title': \"Reddit, I'm in need of some advice and differing opinions here.

Write this statement down 100 times. If you have multiple things you want to manifest, do the same thing, and write it 100 times.\n\n2. Every morning when you wake up, say to yourself, I am receiving good news in the next 24 hours. Take it a step further, and write it down in your manifestation journal. Let these words become a part of your daily routine. This is a powerful, energizing statement that begins to attract everything to you right away.\n\n3. Repeat Thank you, universe, for giving me \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_! I am so grateful! This is a powerful statement, because you are already happy and excited for what you are going to receive. This gratitude also shows that you trust and believe in what is about to happen for you. Gratitude raises your frequency and puts you in receiving mode.\n\n4. In the morning, when you wake up, spend 15 minutes visualizing what you want to happen. See the image as clearly as possible. Smile as you watch the vision of you receiving what you are focused on manifesting. Invoke a feeling of happiness and excitement with the vision. Repeat the visualization again before bedtime. Let that be the last thing you think about before falling asleep.\n\n5. Start sending love to what you want to receive. Love is the highest frequency, and can influence your attraction level toward what you want to welcome into your life. This is a miraculous technique, because you are going above any mental chatter or ideas about how and when things will happen.\n\n6. Answer these six questions in your manifestation journal, and read them daily for the next seven days.  What would you be doing right now if you manifested what you wanted?  How would you feel?  What would your life be like?  Who would you share all your blessings with?  Who would be the first person you shared your good news with?  How would they look, sound, and feel about your manifestation? The goal of these questions is to help you feel the emotion and step into the reality of what it would be like for you to have exactly what you want.\n\n7. For the next seven days, do some kind of physical activity that works best for you, and repeat your manifestation affirmations during your workout. Since your body is releasing serotonin during your workout, you can connect your words to that state, and your body and mind will be very alert to absorb it all in.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': 'xxydp6', 'title': '7 day speed manifestation', 'author': 'Beladinotte', 'subreddit': 'lawofattraction', 'subreddit_id': '2rfq0', 'body': \"I found this in the book 'Manifest now' by Idil Ahmed and I was wondering if anyone tried it.\\n\\n1.

I wasn't even a particularly active young adult, mostly played video games and stuff. As I've gotten older and my metabolism has slowed a bit, and I've had an income to support an insane amount of eating like crap, I went from \\~150 to \\~198 over the course of several years.\n\nMy wife and I recently went through a traumatic life event and had a lot of time to ourselves, and we noticed that we could probably would be a bit better off if we looked at what we were eating and got some decent exercise. I'm probably not in a dangerous or particularly unhealthy weight by any means but I was unsatisfied with how my body looked and wanted to finally get into decent shape. And somehow I have harnessed the energy from this traumatic event as the fuel I needed to accomplish just that.\n\nRight now I'm eating 1,800 calories a day, a 500 calorie cut from my estimated 2,300 BMR.\n\nI've found eating just 1,800 calories a day is very very very hard to just be completely honest. Not just because I feel hungry all the time (which I often do - thank god for water and zero calorie drinks), but more so because the foods that are lower in calories and make you feel full for longer simply do not taste good to me because I am accustom to eating like shit all the time. Further, I had already cut out sugared drinks (except morning coffee :D) from my diet a bit ago, so I'm not getting any credit from that either unfortunately.. I suspect over the last decade prior to quitting sugared drinks I've averaged at least 3 sugared sodas a day. That alone was 500+ calories a day. Wow. There were days in college I cleared a 12 pack of mountain dew easily. Yikes.\n\nI looked at some meals I would regularly eat and was absolutely shocked how much calories I was eating in a day.. breakfast a McDonalds sandwich and hash brown plus a Coke - 800 calories. Then for lunch a Wendy's medium Baconator combo - 1600 calories. That alone was 2,400 calories, and you can bet I ate another 1,500 for dinner. Holy shit. Don't forget dessert or ice cream OMG. And this is with no exercise, sitting at a desk all day long. No wonder I felt so out of energy all the time.\n\nOn a diet of 1,800 calories its almost impossible to eat fast food and feel full. The stuff just goes in one end and comes out the other and you are left fat and hungry, basically. So now we're half way through the month and we've spent 60% less on food out compared to the prior month. Made way more meals at home, with easily measurable portions and calorie calculation. I love cooking and we have tons of great recipes we've been really enjoying.\n\nOn top of all this we starting working out. Nothing insane or advanced. My goal is to get my heart rate up for at least 90 mins a week. Usually this is 3 workouts for 30 minutes each on M\/W\/F. We're just doing cardio bodyweight exercises (no equipment needed) and stationary cycle. The occasional run as well if it's not hot. We also try to frequently walk the dogs 30+ mins which also burns calories. Today we did an extra workout so we could have extra calories to eat pizza at a party this afternoon.

I started out in the industry in May 2015 as a co-op at a SMB SAAS company in Toronto, Ontario. From day one, I was lucky enough to get my hands dirty in some 'devops' tooling, doing fairly easy tasks such as writing Puppet manifests and things like that. \n\nI don't think I'm a super star, but I performed very well mainly due to working hard and putting in tons of hours after work to really learn our tooling (this stuff is a passion for me atm). I also built up a really good relationship with my boss, which I have a feeling will extend past our current job. I got offered a full time position at 48000, starting as a Junior Sysadmin\/Devops Engineer in Jan 2016. I know I could have made more in other places (my friends on HelpDesk at other places were making more as co-ops), I figured that the experience that I would be getting from this place would be more valuable at my age. \n\nAnd that came very true. In this past year I was a key role in several successful projects that were mission critical to the company. I really don't like talking myself up (and struggle even to write this), but I've spent a lot (probably unhealthy amounts) of time working on my skillset to a point where pretty much aside from one very smart architect, I know our tooling better than anyone else. \n\nI'm pretty much always the guy fixing things\/explaining things to my colleagues. I actually love helping out (I would consider every team member of mine a friend), but what irks me is that I recently found out that they are making a decent amount more than me (~75k) and they are newer hires than me. Bottom line is: despite the difference in years in the industry and title\/position, I honestly, and as humbly as one can be writing this, feel like I'm more valuable from a work standpoint. \n\nRecently in the last few months, 2\/3 very senior guys left (from poaching), and the remaining 1 (the boss whom I have a great relationship with) got promoted to management. He's working on changing everyone titles and noted that mine will be like everyone else's but have 'Technical Lead' as a prefix or something as a way of acknowledging my hardwork\/success this far. This is also a result of new changes to a very big project (automating our environment provisioning, deployments etc) that I'm now technically leading (ie designing things for others members to work on) since my boss is now formally management after his promotion and now above all the fun stuff. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTLDR: So here's my question (thanks if you've read up to this point): Despite having very little experience in regards to years in the industry and being very young, would it be unreasonable to be asking for a big raise (from 50k to 85k) if I have been acknowledged by my boss as being the most valuable (in terms of ability\/performance) member on a team of employees who are making roughly 75k? Should I only reasonably expect a jump like that through a job change? What do you think?\n\nThanks for your time and thanks especially for putting up with my shameless self plugging.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': '5o6syr', 'title': 'Doing Salary Research...Need \"devops\" career advice\/how much should I be asking for?', 'author': 'thethrows8213', 'subreddit': 'devopsjobs', 'subreddit_id': '357dp', 'body': \"Cross-posting in \/r\/devops\\n\\nHey everyone,\\n\\nI'm writing in hopes of getting a more realistic understanding of how much I should be making in terms of salary. \\n\\nHere's my story.

{"id":"1625528","text":"Title: Arctic: a new zone of geopolitical confrontation\nThe text below was posted in an online community called ecology in the year 2021:\n\nThe interest in the Arctic region has increased dramatically. Global  warming was one of its main prerequisites. The icebergs that once  drowned the Titanic are defrosting. In Danish Greenland, the melting  of islands ice sheet increased intensity. Permafrost began to thaw in  the great spaces of the Russian Far North.\n\nIn turn, melting of underwater permafrost in the seas of the Eastern  Arctic accelerated twofold compared with the previous century, and  reached 18 centimeters per year. As a result, the thinned layer of  underwater permafrost came close to the methane zone. This led to the  destabilization of the area and massive emissions of the greenhouse gas  methane. If this continues, release of only 1% of the methane reserves  from the shelf of the seas of the Eastern Arctic into the atmosphere  will critically change the climate on the entire planet.\n\nBut if geologists, oceanographers, ecologists and many other  professions treat the North Pole region as an indicator of current  climate change process, then the worlds leading politicians turned  their eyes to the Arctic as a zone of potential conflicts.\n\nAt Geneva meeting on June 16, 2021, the presidents of the United  States and Russia mentioned the Arctic among the many different topics  discussed. Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin agreed to hold talks on the  Arctic, the delimitation of the lines of influence in the region,  possible partial demilitarization of a number of Arctic zones and  environmental cooperation.\n\nSince China has become the prevalent direction of US foreign policy,  Washington needs to achieve at least temporary stabilization in all  other problem areas. The priority of the Biden administration will be  the implementation of new strategies to counter the global influence of  the PRC (in response to the repression in Hong Kong, to the use of  labor camps in Xinjiang, daring operations in cyberspace and massive  theft of intellectual property). Therefore, it is important for  Washington to reduce the growing conflict potential of the Arctic  region.\n\nOn the one hand, the rapidly melting ice opens up previously  unprecedented opportunities in the Arctic for the development of  minerals in the coastal zone, on the shelf and at the bottom of the  Arctic Ocean. On the other hand, not all the Arctic continental shelf  territories have clear boundaries despite they are assigned to the  United States, Canada, Russia, Denmark and Norway. Generally speaking,  the Russian Federation pins high hopes on the Arctic region regarding  the growth of its geo-economic influence, and the United States shall  not allow an increase of the Russias and Chinas influence in the  Arctic.\n\nIn May 2021, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken made a special  northern tour  he visited Denmark, Greenland and Iceland, urging the  need to neutralize the increased ambitions of the Russian Federation and  China in the Arctic. On May 17, he visited the former US\/NATO Keflavik  airbase (Iceland) and negotiated the deployment of US Navy P-8 Poseidon  Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (although the Pentagon decided to resume  operation of this airbase due to the increasing Russian military  activity, back in 2015).\n\nOn May 19, A. Blinken arrived to Reykjavik, where a meeting of the  foreign ministers of the Arctic Council took place which includes eight  Arctic countries  five coastal states plus Iceland, Sweden and Finland,  as well as six organizations of Arctic indigenous peoples. Today, the  Arctic Council is the main platform for resolving issues related to the  territories around the North Pole.\n\nDuring the meeting, the temporary chairmanship of the Arctic Council  transited from Iceland to Russia for two years (until May 2023). A draft  strategic plan for the Arctic Council for the next 10 years was  released. Issues of cooperation between the countries of the region, of  coordination of actions for ensuring the development of the Arctic,  protection of the environment, culture, traditions and languages of the  indigenous peoples of the region were discussed.\n\nAlso, eight Arctic Council member states discussed the feasibility of  expanding the activities of another international platform  the  International Arctic Forum, whose members are the five coastal states of  the Arctic region (USA, Canada, Russia, Denmark and Norway), while  Iceland, Sweden and Finland are only attempting to become full members  of this organization (having the status of observer countries so far).\n\nAlthough the transition of the two-year chairmanship of the Arctic  Council from Iceland to Russia is a routine bureaucratic procedure, the  rest of the member countries of this organization are seriously  concerned about the Russian Federations attempts to use its right to  form the current agenda for rough and overt promotion of its own  expansionist interests. At least this is how Moscow has been acting on  the international arena for the past 7 years. Washington believes that  now the Arctic can be another area of geopolitical confrontation  alongside those between the United States and the Russian Federation in  Syria (and the Middle East), Libya (and Central Africa), Venezuela (and  Latin America), and Ukraine (and the post-Soviet space).\n\nThe greatest concern in this regard is expressed by the Kingdom of  Norway, since Moscow and Oslo are in serious controversies over the  Svalbard archipelago. According to international law, Svalbard is part  of Norway, however, Russia claims its right of economic exploitation of  the polar archipelago and its shelf zone.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation in the Arctic Council  Nikolay Korchunov said that the Svalbard issue is not  multidimensional, since it is not interesting for Canada and the United  States. Accordingly, the agenda of the Arctic Council will include those  issues which fell within the scope of interest of all eight countries  of this organization. That is, issues related to the archipelago will  remain the subject of bilateral dialogue between Russia and Norway.  At the same time, it is possible that Oslo will not want to remain  one-on-one with an unpredictable and aggressive Moscow and will make  every effort to involve both Ottawa and Washington in resolving this  issue.\n\nAccording to both the Norwegian AldriMer newspaper and the Russian  liberal opposition Novaya Gazeta newspaper, starting at least from 2016,  some armed people regularly appeared in the Svalbard archipelago, which  is, like its coastal waters, a demilitarized zone. Moreover, it is  alleged that, having changed into civilian clothes, Russian fighters  disembarked even on mainland Norway. The outlets referred to four  sources in three countries, Norwegian counterintelligence and US  intelligence.\n\nThe case is regular servicemen of the Russian special forces (from  the Armed Forces and Rosgvardia), as well as representatives of  mercenary formations  PMC Wagner and Kadyrovs detachment.\n\nIn particular, we are talking about Chechen militants who are  personally subordinate to the odious leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  A separate webpage on the website of the Russian Special Forces  University, the only private university in the Russian Federation, where  professional security officials are trained (Chechnya, Gudermes), is  devoted to the Arctic exercises of the Kadyrovs squad. In 2018,  R. Kadyrov personally bragged about the participation of Chechen  fighters in exercises in Murmansk and Franz Josef Land, however, he  prudently did not mention his fighters illegal visit to the territory  of Norway.\n\nThe only airport in Svalbard falls under control of Norway.  Therefore, the Russian military arrives at the archipelago on the P-650  special-purpose midget submarine submarine, intended for the covert  transfer of manpower to the rear of the enemy. This allows them  remaining unnoticed for a some time, until the Norwegian authorities  will learn about the landing of the Russian troops.\n\nBased on the above, it is quite understandable why the official Oslo  is so concerned with Russias two-years presidency in the Arctic  Council. At the same time, Norway (as well as other Arctic countries) is  likely to place hopes on the US President J. Bidens preparedness to  confrontation with authoritarian Russia, and therefore will prevent it  from making any proposals on the current agenda that contradict the  interests of democratic states.\n\n[**Source**](https:\/\/democratic-europe.eu\/2021\/07\/07\/arctic-a-new-zone-of-geopolitical-confrontation\/)","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': 'og6g6s', 'title': 'Arctic: a new zone of geopolitical confrontation', 'author': 'Alex82smirnov', 'subreddit': 'ecology', 'subreddit_id': '2qoii', 'body': 'The interest in the Arctic region has increased dramatically.

The outlets referred to four  sources in three countries, Norwegian counterintelligence and US  intelligence.\\n\\nThe case is regular servicemen of the Russian special forces (from  the Armed Forces and Rosgvardia), as well as representatives of  mercenary formations  PMC Wagner and Kadyrovs detachment.\\n\\nIn particular, we are talking about Chechen militants who are  personally subordinate to the odious leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  A separate webpage on the website of the Russian Special Forces  University, the only private university in the Russian Federation, where  professional security officials are trained (Chechnya, Gudermes), is  devoted to the Arctic exercises of the Kadyrovs squad. In 2018,  R. Kadyrov personally bragged about the participation of Chechen  fighters in exercises in Murmansk and Franz Josef Land, however, he  prudently did not mention his fighters illegal visit to the territory  of Norway.\\n\\nThe only airport in Svalbard falls under control of Norway.  Therefore, the Russian military arrives at the archipelago on the P-650  special-purpose midget submarine submarine, intended for the covert  transfer of manpower to the rear of the enemy. This allows them  remaining unnoticed for a some time, until the Norwegian authorities  will learn about the landing of the Russian troops.\\n\\nBased on the above, it is quite understandable why the official Oslo  is so concerned with Russias two-years presidency in the Arctic  Council. At the same time, Norway (as well as other Arctic countries) is  likely to place hopes on the US President J. Bidens preparedness to  confrontation with authoritarian Russia, and therefore will prevent it  from making any proposals on the current agenda that contradict the  interests of democratic states.\\n\\n[**Source**](https:\/\/democratic-europe.eu\/2021\/07\/07\/arctic-a-new-zone-of-geopolitical-confrontation\/)', 'body_is_trimmed': False, 'score': 4, 'over_18': False, 'num_comments': 1, 'created_utc': 1625748237}","check_char_repetition_criteria":0.0556964945,"check_flagged_words_criteria":0.0,"check_stop_word_ratio_criteria":0.4546805349}

My problem is, that the insertion hurts like an absolute bitch. I'm still only 15 and a virgin, and while inserting I was as relaxed as I could. I'm currently using the diamond fold, since that worked better for me than the seven fold.\n\nFor about 80% of the insertion is completely fine and I don't even feel it, but then the pain suddenly goes from 0 to a 100 and the insertion becomes way too painful. I don't have access to any lubricant currently other than water. I considered using vaseline or some aloe vera products, but from what i understood the lube is only supposed to be water based, since oil based ones can damage the cup. I just don't understand, why does the end hurt so much when most of the insertion is fine? The pain is a very sharp pain and it feels unbearable (though my pain tolerance is quite low). I have yet to try and do this in the shower, but I'll try that later today.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Are menstrual cups just not for me? I know this is super early for me to be this worried, since really this is only my first day trying to use it, but I'm feeling frustrated. I knew that the start was going to be rocky and that the learning curve is long, but I wasn't expecting pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: alright, so I tried inserting it in the shower.

I found two jobs that will hire me next week; one is an Medical Assistant job that pays well and even has a sign on bonus and is full-time and the second job is part time scribe position.... My question is, should I take either one of the jobs? Or should I just slug it out and wait till I sit for my second attempt which is just a few weeks out? Because professionally I would hate to be that guy who got hired and immediately quits. What do you guys think..

But let me explain. I haven't rejected the possibility that I'm an asshole. \n\nI'm 29, wife is 31. We've been married 8 years. Two children, 8 and 10. Oldest is chronically ill, and expensive because of it. All relevant background information. \n\nI don't ask for much in our relationship. Just contribution, basically. I've asked her simply to never get to the point where she's coasting, or to stop making an effort to contribute something positive to the family. We've agreed that it's not an unreasonable expectation for either partner to have of the other. We both understand this goes both directions. \n\nI work 70 hours a week at a job I hate. We had kids young, and there weren't a lot of options for me. We were going to be homeless very soon, so I jumped at the opportunity to work in the field, and I've been in it for 8 years, hating every minute of it. But it had to be done. This is kind of where things started. \n\nI told my wife that I needed help. She had a part time retail job at that time, and was going to school. We had a frank conversation about my job, and how I couldn't stick with it forever, but I was willing to do it as long as was necessary for her to finish her education and get into the adult workforce. She agreed, then almost immediately dropped out of school because \"raising kids and going to school part time was too difficult\". I was angry, but she went to work full time, albeit at a job that didn't really add much to the household income, so I was still stuck. For 8 years, she's done nothing to improve, and any conversation about it just leads to self pity, but no effort. \n\nI'm working incredibly long hours, so I don't get as much done around the house as I would like to, but I do the best I can. Dishes need washing? I'm on it. She's got to work late once in a while? No problem, I'll take care of dinner. I don't resent having to pick up the slack. It's what a spouse does. \n\nMore recently, our house has become a pig sty. She's kind of a hoarder, although not as bad as you see on TV, she just won't get rid of anything that might be useful 10 years from now. There's nowhere left to put anything. She absolutely will not clean the bedroom, there are piles of her laundry all over, and they will sit there until I gather them. Her dresser is piled high with random garbage, every few weeks I'll go through and take care of her stuff when I'm cleaning up my space, but in a day or two, it's right back to the same. I'm terrified somebody is going to drop by unannounced and see all this. I make excuses to never host any kind of gathering at the house, I'm so ashamed of it.  Stuff like that. For 8 years, I've been trying to communicate that I can't live that way. I can't spend 14 hours stressed out at work, and then come home to that. It's incredibly stressful, and I don't expect the house to be spotless, but that the level of filth everywhere just isn't reasonable. She's agreed each time that I have a right to expect that she takes care of this basic level of tidying, and understands that I can't handle the stress of living in a knee deep pile of shit, but does nothing about it. It just isn't important to her. \n\nI'm noticing a pattern. She's okay with me working this job. She's okay living like a slob, despite my repeated pleas to help me fix it. Because it all works for her. The fact that these things are killing me doesn't really matter. It's not just these two examples, but they're the ones I'm most frustrated with at the moment. She simply doesn't care that I'm struggling, until it has a direct effect on her. \n\nI've always tried to take care of the things she wants and needs. She wanted a house? I put in as much overtime as possible and bought one. New car? Got that, too. It makes me happy to take care of the things that are important to her. I don't expect her to feel exactly like I do, but it seems that anything that's important to me is automatically a lower priority to her. And what really bothers me is that I don't see being able to live like this anymore. I resent the hell out of her. And when I get into these moments of white hot anger I get to thinking about whether I married her for the right reasons. She pestered me about it for a long time, and eventually it seemed like the right thing to do. I wonder sometimes if she was a mistake.  I'm probably being unreasonable, but her attitude is having a very real and very detrimental effect on our relationship, and no amount of communication seems to mitigate any of it. And I don't want to be with someone who doesn't see me as important enough to work for. \n\nTl;Dr:  wife expects me to provide for her wants and needs, but won't make an effort to help with things that are important to me, despite repeated communication.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': '9dol8l', 'title': 'Wife deprioritizes what is important to me.', 'author': 'hrowaway1989', 'subreddit': 'marriageadvice', 'subreddit_id': '2r6wv', 'body': 'That sounds selfish.

{"id":"88568465","text":"Title: The other way to tour a school\nThe text below was posted in an online community called ApplyingToCollege in the year 2018:\n\nI have gone on tirades in the past about school-sanctioned admissions tours, but I haven't done a good enough job of explaining why I dislike them. Last year, I applied for transfer admission and was accepted to a Tier 1 school for engineering. I happened to know someone at the school (we had met at a competition in high school) and I called him up to see if he would be willing to host me for a weekend. He agreed, we set a date, I booked a flight, and a month or so later, I arrived at the school.\n\nI first went to the admissions office, checked in, picked up a map, and declined the official admissions tour. My friend was still in class at the time so in the meantime, I went to check out some of the buildings. The engineering building was close to where I was, so I tried walking to it but couldnt find the entrance, and so I ended up walking randomly through a building on campus. As I was looking around and taking pictures, I met a Ph.D student who was also studying engineering. I told him that I was an accepted transfer student and we got to talking about the education at the school and how it compared to his undergraduate school (which was an Ivy). He helped me find the wing I was looking for in the engineering building and we exchanged contact information. He ended up inviting me to a small party (couldnt go because it was after my flight home) and we still keep in touch from time to time, even a year later.\n\nNow in the right place, I started knocking on doors on some of the research labs. I introduced myself to one professor in the lab and he gave me a tour of the place and explained his research to me. I also met his coworkers and other assistants and we discussed undergraduate research at the school. I took his business card and we exchanged a few emails.\n\nAfter I left his lab, I visited the engineering deans office where I discussed credit transfer and other aspects of transfer life at the school. The dean was super helpful and also referred me to an office for transfer students in the admissions office. I made sure to take his info, and he also connected me with the engineering department head in case I had more specific questions.\n\nAfter speaking with the dean, I kept exploring other labs and talking with more researchers. I left after some time to meet my friend for lunch, and I had already gained a really up-close and personal view of what I could expect from the profs and facilities at the school.\n\nAt lunch, my friend checked me into the dining hall, which gave me a feel for the culture there. I noticed that no one was eating alone and everyone seemed pretty relaxed. My friend introduced me to a few of his friends and we had a great conversation about the school and the general student atmosphere.\n\nAfter lunch, my friend had another class, so I tagged along with him and one of his friends to the lecture (not in my major). Obviously all college professors are different, but I liked that this professor incorporated time into his lesson plans specifically for students to ask questions. I noticed that the students felt comfortable asking questions at any time during the lecture, which my friend confirmed was common in most classes.\n\nAfter the lecture, my friend and I split up again because he had another class. I walked with the other guy over to a different engineering building, and along the way discussed some other aspects of the school and life there.\n\nAt the other engineering building, I explored the facilities, spoke with some students doing projects there, and again met with professors and discussed their curricula.\n\nAfter exploring that facility, I went back to the admissions office where I found the transfer students office. I spoke for about an hour with a transfer student just like me that had decided to accept the schools offer, and we spent a lot of time talking about credit transfer, making friends, and other aspects of the transfer experience. I took that students contact information in case I had any other questions.\n\nI walked around the library, spoke to the financial aid office, met with more students at another facility I was interested in, and walked around some other areas of the campus before reuniting with my friend at his dorm. I finally got to put my bag down and I started up a conversation with some people on his dorm floor. We talked about their experiences at the school and general student life.\n\nThe rest is a bit of a blur. My friend and his floormates and I went to dinner, then came back to the dorm lounge and hung out and had a few drinks and chatted for the rest of the night. I slept on the couch in the dorms lounge.\n\nThe next day, I thanked my friend and did some exploring of the surrounding area outside of the campus. I had lunch at a local place and then left. I had an amazing time.\n\n-----\n\nNot everyone can tour a college in this way, but if you have the opportunity to spend the night, I highly recommend it. If youre going to be spending 5-6 figures and 4 or more years of your life somewhere, its worth it to take a day to really scout it out. Tours are designed to keep you away from students, and any brief chit chat you may have with a tour guide is no replacement for a no-holds-barred hours long conversation with someone thats not afraid to tell you about the bad things at the school. In all of my time at my current college, Ive never spoken with anyone that was on a tour or been approached by such a person. In my opinion, thats backwards and wrongthe people youll meet are way more important than the dining hall food, the random school trivia, and the dorm room closet space. I am so glad that I didnt take the official tour of that school.\n\nHigh school juniors: befriend the seniors around you. They can give you this kind of experience. If your family has especially low income, call the admissions office of some schools youre interested (TODAY!!) to ask if they have a fly-in program. These programs simulate the story above and pair you with another student to spend a night on campus (getting into a fly-in program also gives you an extremely high chance of acceptance at that school).

My husband and I have recently made our exit together, and it's brought up feelings for both of us about our wedding. It wasn't the most pleasant experience, overall. Beyond the fact that we never actually made any vows to renew, and the ceremony had nothing to do with us, we also had family issues. My mother is abusive, and my husband and I made the decision that to keep the peace, she could have the wedding. She insisted on making our reception fit for an overly-stereotypical princess-obsessed 6-year-old girl, and intentionally made me late for the sealing because she didn't like the time that we picked. (A side note: while he was waiting for me to arrive, my husband-to-be was informed by cheerful temple workers that if I didn't show up, they'd find someone else for him to marry that day). I had NO ONE who could go to our sealing from my friends and family except for my parents, which meant everyone else I loved was waiting outside. We'd planned to exchange rings after leaving the temple, but our sealer told us right before the ceremony that we weren't allowed to do that. We didn't even end up with good pictures from our wedding.\n\nAt the time, we were mostly okay with all of this. We had decided the wedding wasn't worth being upset over, because we were going to have an amazing marriage, and that was what mattered. And we have had a wonderful marriage, and I absolutely believe that's more important. But in hindsight, it sucks that we went through a cookie cutter wedding that had nothing to do with the love that we had for each other then, and no promises of the love we feel for each other now.

Restoration, manhoods, etc.\nThe text below was posted in an online community called foreskin_restoration in the year 2017:\n\nI'll try to keep this brief, but basically, I was cut when I was an infant.  I'm pretty much at a CI-3 when soft but more like a 1 or 2 when hard.  The side effects that I've been experiencing (Sex problems, horribly uncomfortable nocturnal erections that wake me up all the time to go \"Ouch.\" and adjust myself, etc) convinced me to try doing something about it.\n\nOver the past year I've tried a few things, I started with restoration methods but quickly kinda ran into a problem.  Most of the sensation I have seems to come from the corona, and from the little bit of foreskin I've got left.  Stretching this seemed to really irritate it and I stopped most of it because I was afraid of screwing up the nerves that actually feel good to me.\n\nThat leads to my first question: Am I putting any of my existing sensations at risk with the current restoration methods?  Do I need to be concerned at all?\n\nI really would like to get back to having more coverage and hopefully more sensation.\n\nThen I started looking at other stuff...\n\nI spent some money on the \"Senslip\" things.  I found that none of the four they sent in my trial package actually fit, and even when I could get one on the very instant that I moved it shifted out of position.  Didn't work.  I was attracted by the promise of a quick easy solution, and the idea that I could put it on and go about my day without having to awkwardly remove a device to urinate.\n\nNext I stumbled across the \"Manhood\" thing.  I got them to stay in place overnight, the painful nocturnal erections went away, all in all they're very comfortable and when I wake up in the morning I do sometimes feel like I've got slightly better sensation from spending 6-10 hours not being chafed by something.  But they absolutely WILL NOT STAY ON during the day when I'm running around at work, climbing ladders, etc, and obviously you need to remove them to urinate.  So any improvement I've gotten is gone within an hour of waking up.\n\nThis is my second question now: Does anyone here use the 'Manhood' all day successfully?  Is it actually worth the time and effort?  And finally if I'm wearing one for 8 hours overnight is it OK to wear it again on a following night or should I be washing them after one use?\n\nThe last thing I tried was the \"moreskin\" thing.......Uh....So I get that to stay in place but within a few hours it feels itchy, tight, and painful and I wake up to remove it if I'm wearing it overnight.  During the day they make urination without removing them difficult but possible, but...Difficult.\n\nFinal question here: Are those actually meant to be a prosthetic foreskin to improve sensation or help with restoration or are those just a toy?","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': '5o429n', 'title': 'So what do I even do now?

{"id":"111362010","text":"Title: Davos and Urri, Davos and Uri (Spoilers Extended)\nThe text below was posted in an online community called asoiaf in the year 2021:\n\nI like to find and think about and write about the seemingly endless supply of \"rhyming\" going on in *A* ***Song*** *of Ice &amp; Fire*: parallels between characters\/stories, motif-recursivity across time and space, etc. This is a quick post about an interesting and (I think) undeniable \"rhyme\" that recently cropped up in discussion in the replies to the \/r\/pureasoiaf version of [a post I did](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pureasoiaf\/comments\/kqchn9\/greyer_after_all_davos_seaworth_sailor_captain\/) proposing that Davos could be the Sailor's Wife's \"Sailor\". *(It's wholly independent of that theory; this post doesn't care what you think of it.)*\n\n\/U\/wild2098 commented that the \"Davos is the Sailor\" theory dovetailed with his belief that Davos is ironborn. He noted that if Davos is the Sailor, this would mean Davos has multiple wives, which is an ironborn trait. (Ironmen who practice the old way have their one \"rock wife\" but can have many \"sea wives\".) He noted Davos's missing fingers, presumably like an ironman whose fucked up while \"dancing\" the \"finger dance\". He noted that Davos being tagged\/positioned as a \"dead man\" who yet lives\n&gt;**Dead man was his name for Davos.** When he came by in the morning, it was always, \"Here, porridge for the dead man.\" At night it was, \"Blow out the candle, dead man.\" *(A Dance With Dragons Davos IV)*\n\njibes with the ironborn mantra, *\"what is dead may never die...\"* The fact that Davos is tagged as \"the grey man\"\n&gt;\"A grey man,\" she said. \"Neither white nor black, but partaking of both. Is that what you are, Ser Davos?\"\n\n&gt;\"What if I am? It seems to me that most men are grey.\" *(A Clash of Kings Davos II)*\n\nsounds like something an ironman of House Greyjoy might be called.\n\nI agree with \/u\/wild2098 *to the extent* that there's certainly a \"rhyme\" in all this, although whether it means Davos *is* literally ironborn (whether \"merely\" by blood or by rearing\/culture, too) or whether it's just positioning him as a *figurative* ironman or setting up a \"rhyme\" for some other purpose, I'm not sure.\n\nOK, so, you might be thinking that Davos's amputated fingers don't just remind us of finger-dancing ironmen in general, but that they more specifically recall the story of how the Greyjoy's maester tried to sew *Urrigon \"Urri\" Greyjoy's* accidentally-amputated-in-a-finger-dance fingers back on, resulting in a terrible infection which led the maester to amputate Urri's entire arm, in turn leading Balon to vengefully amputate the Greyjoys' maester's fingers (again a la Stannis-and-Davos):\n&gt;**A flying axe took off half of Urri's hand when he was ten-and-four, playing at the finger dance** whilst his father and his elder brothers were chavezmichael@example.net. Lord Quellon's third wife had been a Piper of Pinkmaiden Castle, a girl with big soft breasts and brown doe's eyes. **Instead of healing Urri's hand the Old Way, with fire and seawater, she gave him to her green land maester, who swore that he could sew back the missing fingers.** He did that, and later he used potions and poltices and herbs, but **the hand mortified and Urri took a fever. By the time the maester sawed his arm off, it was too late.**\n\n&gt;**When Balon heard what had befallen Urri, he removed three of the maester's fingers with a cook's cleaver** and sent his father's Piper wife to sew them back on. *(A Feast For Crows The Prophet)*\n\nObviously thinking of how the story of Urri and the Maester was reminiscent of (i.e. \"rhymed\" with) Davos having his fingers chopped off, \/u\/IllyrioMoParties jumped in the comments to (semi) jokingly say:\n&gt;brb looking at a map of Switzlernad [sic] for a town called \"Urri\"\n\nHe said this because the name \"Davos\", of course, recalls the famous town [Davos, Switzerland](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Davos), where the [World Economic Forum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Economic_Forum) holds its annual meetings of super-elites, to the horror and\/or delight of conspiracy theorists, leftists, rightists, etc.\n\nOf course there isn't a Swiss town called Urri.\n\n***Dramatic pause.***\n\nBut there damn sure *is* a Swiss *canton* (state, basically, in U.S. terms) called *Uri*. See: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canton_of_Uri\n\nAs IllyrioMoParites said in response to my pointing this out:\nhttps:\/\/i.imgflip.com\/2t1ddy.jpg\n\nThat's not a coincidence. That's an intentional, authored *rhyme*.\n\nDoes it mean Davos is ironborn?\n\nThat he's somehow figuratively ironborn?\n\nIs it \"merely\" another instance of rhyming pursuant to a broader literary project GRRM's engaged in which at this point we can only see the edges of, per which he's in some senses telling the same story over and over 100s of times within the bounds of *ASOIAF*?\n\nIs it just \"cute\", GRRM having some aimless fun? (I strongly suspect this will be the most popular interpretation.)\n\nI'm not sure, but regardless it's no accident that Dude-named-for-famous-Swiss-town's most salient trait is having his fingers chopped off, while Other-famous-finger-chopped-off-dude is named for a Swiss canton.\n\nPretty neat.\n\n###Bonus Tinfoil\nI have argued elsewhere (see Part 2 of [this series](https:\/\/asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com\/kg3page\/)) that Qhorin Halfhand is the White Bull, Ser Gerold Hightower. I've argued that one of a myriad number of things encoding Qhorin's identity is his missing-fingers-based \"rhyme\" with Davos (given that Davos is a \"dead\" men who isn't dead, that Davos is a King's Hand, i.e.. a *qhoran*, i.e. advisor, just as the Lord Commander of the King's Guard would be a *qhoran*, etc.).\n\nNow we have this little Davos\/Urri parallel pointing us to Davos and Uri, Switzerland. So what?\n\nSo, what is the sigil of the canton of Uri? A bull's head, as in \"the White Bull\", Gerold Hightower.\n\nAnd from the Uri wikipedia entry:\n&gt;There is a long-standing popular etymology associating the name with r, the German name of the **aurochs**. This tradition may date as far back as the Middle High German period, reflected in the introduction of the cantonal seal showing a bull's head in the 13th century. Beginning in the 17th century, **the bull of Uri (Uristier) came to be associated with the name of the *Taurisci* in learned speculation.**\n\nUri is thus associated with \"aurochs\", which will be infinitely familiar to anyone who's read *ASOIAF*, which makes something of a fetish of the word \"aurochs\".\n\nFurther, the Uri-bull is associated with \"the Taurisci\". Who are they?

He noted that if Davos is the Sailor, this would mean Davos has multiple wives, which is an ironborn trait. (Ironmen who practice the old way have their one \"rock wife\" but can have many \"sea wives\".) He noted Davos\\'s missing fingers, presumably like an ironman whose fucked up while \"dancing\" the \"finger dance\". He noted that Davos being tagged\/positioned as a \"dead man\" who yet lives\\n&gt;**Dead man was his name for Davos.** When he came by in the morning, it was always, \"Here, porridge for the dead man.\" At night it was, \"Blow out the candle, dead man.\" *(A Dance With Dragons Davos IV)*\\n\\njibes with the ironborn mantra, *\"what is dead may never die...\"* The fact that Davos is tagged as \"the grey man\"\\n&gt;\"A grey man,\" she said. \"Neither white nor black, but partaking of both. Is that what you are, Ser Davos?\"\\n\\n&gt;\"What if I am? It seems to me that most men are grey.\" *(A Clash of Kings Davos II)*\\n\\nsounds like something an ironman of House Greyjoy might be called.\\n\\nI agree with \/u\/wild2098 *to the extent* that there\\'s certainly a \"rhyme\" in all this, although whether it means Davos *is* literally ironborn (whether \"merely\" by blood or by rearing\/culture, too) or whether it\\'s just positioning him as a *figurative* ironman or setting up a \"rhyme\" for some other purpose, I\\'m not sure.\\n\\nOK, so, you might be thinking that Davos\\'s amputated fingers don\\'t just remind us of finger-dancing ironmen in general, but that they more specifically recall the story of how the Greyjoy\\'s maester tried to sew *Urrigon \"Urri\" Greyjoy\\'s* accidentally-amputated-in-a-finger-dance fingers back on, resulting in a terrible infection which led the maester to amputate Urri\\'s entire arm, in turn leading Balon to vengefully amputate the Greyjoys\\' maester\\'s fingers (again a la Stannis-and-Davos):\\n&gt;**A flying axe took off half of Urri\\'s hand when he was ten-and-four, playing at the finger dance** whilst his father and his elder brothers were away at war. Lord Quellon\\'s third wife had been a Piper of Pinkmaiden Castle, a girl with big soft breasts and brown doe\\'s eyes. **Instead of healing Urri\\'s hand the Old Way, with fire and seawater, she gave him to her green land maester, who swore that he could sew back the missing fingers.** He did that, and later he used potions and poltices and herbs, but **the hand mortified and Urri took a fever. By the time the maester sawed his arm off, it was too late.**\\n\\n&gt;**When Balon heard what had befallen Urri, he removed three of the maester\\'s fingers with a cook\\'s cleaver** and sent his father\\'s Piper wife to sew them back on. *(A Feast For Crows The Prophet)*\\n\\nObviously thinking of how the story of Urri and the Maester was reminiscent of (i.e. \"rhymed\" with) Davos having his fingers chopped off, \/u\/IllyrioMoParties jumped in the comments to (semi) jokingly say:\\n&gt;brb looking at a map of Switzlernad [sic] for a town called \"Urri\"\\n\\nHe said this because the name \"Davos\", of course, recalls the famous town [Davos, Switzerland](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Davos), where the [World Economic Forum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Economic_Forum) holds its annual meetings of super-elites, to the horror and\/or delight of conspiracy theorists, leftists, rightists, etc.\\n\\nOf course there isn\\'t a Swiss town called Urri.\\n\\n***Dramatic pause.***\\n\\nBut there damn sure *is* a Swiss *canton* (state, basically, in U.S. terms) called *Uri*. See: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canton_of_Uri\\n\\nAs IllyrioMoParites said in response to my pointing this out:\\nhttps:\/\/i.imgflip.com\/2t1ddy.jpg\\n\\nThat\\'s not a coincidence. That\\'s an intentional, authored *rhyme*.\\n\\nDoes it mean Davos is ironborn?\\n\\nThat he\\'s somehow figuratively ironborn?\\n\\nIs it \"merely\" another instance of rhyming pursuant to a broader literary project GRRM\\'s engaged in which at this point we can only see the edges of, per which he\\'s in some senses telling the same story over and over 100s of times within the bounds of *ASOIAF*?\\n\\nIs it just \"cute\", GRRM having some aimless fun? (I strongly suspect this will be the most popular interpretation.)\\n\\nI\\'m not sure, but regardless it\\'s no accident that Dude-named-for-famous-Swiss-town\\'s most salient trait is having his fingers chopped off, while Other-famous-finger-chopped-off-dude is named for a Swiss canton.\\n\\nPretty neat.\\n\\n###Bonus Tinfoil\\nI have argued elsewhere (see Part 2 of [this series](https:\/\/asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com\/kg3page\/)) that Qhorin Halfhand is the White Bull, Ser Gerold Hightower. I\\'ve argued that one of a myriad number of things encoding Qhorin\\'s identity is his missing-fingers-based \"rhyme\" with Davos (given that Davos is a \"dead\" men who isn\\'t dead, that Davos is a King\\'s Hand, i.e.. a *qhoran*, i.e. advisor, just as the Lord Commander of the King\\'s Guard would be a *qhoran*, etc.).\\n\\nNow we have this little Davos\/Urri parallel pointing us to Davos and Uri, Switzerland. So what?\\n\\nSo, what is the sigil of the canton of Uri? A bull\\'s head, as in \"the White Bull\", Gerold Hightower.\\n\\nAnd from the Uri wikipedia entry:\\n&gt;There is a long-standing popular etymology associating the name with r, the German name of the **aurochs**. This tradition may date as far back as the Middle High German period, reflected in the introduction of the cantonal seal showing a bull\\'s head in the 13th century. Beginning in the 17th century, **the bull of Uri (Uristier) came to be associated with the name of the *Taurisci* in learned speculation.**\\n\\nUri is thus associated with \"aurochs\", which will be infinitely familiar to anyone who\\'s read *ASOIAF*, which makes something of a fetish of the word \"aurochs\".\\n\\nFurther, the Uri-bull is associated with \"the Taurisci\". Who are they? From https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taurisci:\\n&gt;The Taurisci were a federation of Celtic tribes who dwelt in today\\'s Carinthia and northern Slovenia (Carniola) before the coming of the Romans (c. 200 BC)[1] According to Pliny the Elder, they are the same people known as the Norici.\\n\\nBy another name, might one call them... wildlings? (I.e. the people with whom \"Qhorin\" is intimately associated.)\\n\\n\"Taurisci\" also reminds me of the [\"Tauroctony\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tauroctony), a centerpiece of Mithraism, which jibes with my argument that Jon (a Mithras-figure) killing \"Qhorin\" (the white bull) is a symbolic Tauroctony.

Sex has never been easy but for a long time we were making things work. Within the last two years, she was diagnosed with depression and really depended on me for support as we could not get her medicine or professional help (we were living in another country at the time). Within the last year, we moved back to the states and she began to receive treatment for her depression, started going to therapy, and no longer relied on me to be her main support. Once that pressure moved off of me, I began to realize that I held a lot of resentment towards her and seriously began to question my attraction towards her. Currently, I go to therapy and struggle every day to stay emotionally present but I haven't handled my doubts very well: I have made hurtful comments about her physical appearance, constantly compare her to other woman in my own mind, and feel emotionally empty. I think that I am terrified that I will never experience healthy, 'normal' sex.\n\nI am not sure what I am looking for by posting here, but I feel like I am losing my mind over the guilt and these constant nagging doubts.

You disagree? You either die or end up in a gulag. **Norylska** fouls everything.\n\n**Genndy Antonov** and **Katyushka Leonova** try to survive in Norylska and remain human. Survival is an option. Staying human? Less so. The appeal of the story lies in its handling of characters interactions and discovering how their arcs converge and diverge as they try to stay alive and solve the mystery.\n\n**Gen** starts as a terrible person, traumatized by war and the atrocities he has committed to survive. He wants to become a better man and provide for his family. After being laid off, he accepts the one job offer he should never accept. He joins a Shkut crime family that uses his penchant for violence to achieve their goals. War and hunger turn people into monsters and Gen does many monstrous things throughout the book.\n\n**Katyushka** grew up in a wealthy family, but lost everything and now barely scrapes by in Norylska. Her manipulative boyfriend doesnt make it any easier for her. She takes a job as a secretary, but ends up in the militsia as a peace enforcer. Kat starts as a rather nice person, but it doesnt last. Peace enforcers carry magical stones that twist their memories and personality traits. The stones she gets warp her perception of herself and others, and give her memories of a murder and treachery in the precinct. Soon her choices get limited to getting skinned alive by a crime family or shot in the head by the government. \n\nIts nice to have options.\n\nIn *Norylska Groans*, Fletcher &amp; Snyder explore the darkest corners of the human psyche and describe monstrosities and desires in an explicit and graphic way. Ultra-violence and depth rarely go hand in hand, but I found Norylska both thoughtful, emotionally engaging, and unsettling. Parts of the story will give me nightmares but Ill deal with them. Somehow.\n\nThe authors spiced up the crime and survival story with an intriguing magic system. **Veneficums** draw memories and personality traits from people and store them in stones. Anyone who touches the stone can access everything it stores (memories, abilities, temperament, knowledge). The personality stored in a stone can be stronger than the host and sometimes dominates the shared body. The story revolves around the stones, and the **ways in which memories define our identity**. Its one theme that regularly appears in Fletchers oeuvre and I find it fascinating.\n\n*Norylska Groans* is, probably, the darkest book Ive ever read. Its disturbing, brutal, and bleak. It contains scenes of extreme violence but it also feels deep and thoughtful. I wont forget it soon. The extreme content will polarise readers so think twice before starting it. There is context to the brutality but the authors unflinching approach to it wont sit well with everyone. Personally, I think Norylska Groans is a fantastic and unforgettable book but Ill understand why others will DNF it shortly after starting it.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': 'o0nrxi', 'title': 'Review: Norylska Groans by Michael R.

{"id":"92861049","text":"Title: Trying to get out\nThe text below was posted in an online community called offmychest in the year 2015:\n\n[Part One](http:\/\/redd.it\/3b7sjr)\n[Part Two](http:\/\/redd.it\/3b8enj)\n\nA week or two after that Thanksgiving break, I became very anxious. I like to think that I am mellow person, and as such, not much really gets to me. Unfortunately, being so unfamiliar to stress made it all the more unmanageable when it reared its ugly head. My theory was that whatever caused my break was a combination of my new roommates presence and a calculus project that I had been left without a group to finish in a few days time. The crushing feeling mounted as time passed, and I tried my hardest to relax, going to the gym for several hours a day to bring on the relief that only physical exertion can bring about. But it was not enough. I had and still have a fierce need for freedom. I spent much of my adolescence rearing violently and instinctively against any restriction placed on me. There was something deep inside me that made me fear more than anything the feeling of being trapped. And I felt, with the growing pressure from my studies and my new roommate robbing me of both my sanctuary and my sleep, that what I needed more than anything was to escape.\n\nIt all came to a head on a Tuesday night around ten oclock. After spending several frustrating hours on my dryer trying to get through my physics homework over the tightness in my chest and the frantic beating of my heart suddenly becoming fast and erratic if I did not consciously slow it, I returned to my room, pacing like a caged tiger. I opened and closed my fists at my sides as I drew the muscles of my shoulders and back as if trying to open my chest and release whatever it is that sat so heavily inside of me. I could feel myself slipping out of control, and I tried to talk to my roommate and explain that something was wrong to keep myself centered. She offered a hug and some vague words of comfort. She was one of those people that took a psychology class because people were so interesting and she believed she had a natural instinct for reading peoples thoughts. I warned her that things were about to get weird when I began to lay down on my bed and stack heavy backpacks and the like on my chest. I felt as though the weight would help me feel more grounded, and it did, but it wasnt enough to stop me from running. \n\nI was almost panicked at this point, desperate to find some outlet, that I began dressing myself in long underwear and a thick fleece. I packed my backpack with my sleeping bag and sleeping pad, preparing to walk and keep walking. I brought water but purposely omitted any sort of food, knowing that there would be a possibility that I would not return the next morning if something as physical and undeniable as hunger didnt draw me back down into civilization. \n\nAt this point, it was dark, and there was no moon as I began to walk towards the hills. It was slightly less than an hour before I reached the forest. I spent the next few hours almost maniacally wandering the dark twisting trails of the foothills. It was black as pitch and the November cold chilled my bones deeply. But I kept walking because something so basic and so strong drove me onwards, as if I would be able to find my solace around the next turn. \n\nWhat finally snapped me out of it was a particularly bad fall. The tip of my foot caught on a rock and sent me sprawling into a tree, bruising my shoulder painfully, for it had caught the brunt of my weight. At this point, exhausted and out of tears, I realized how stupid I was being. How moronic it was to be out and alone in an unfamiliar neck of the woods. I turned back and began the journey to the dorm. \n\nBy the time I stepped inside, it was nearly just before two in the morning. Still upset and very tired, I refused to go back to my room. I had just spent so much energy trying to escape that room that the very thought of returning and - worse - not being able to sleep after everything Id done was enough to send me back to my dryer in the corner of the laundry room. Still in my hiking clothes, I dumped my backpack on the floor and piled myself into a ball. \n\nHe woke me up by gently shaking me, pushing on my arm. He told me it was three fifeteen. I nodded. Embarrassed at being caught, exhausted, stiff, and not wanting to explain to this boy that I wanted to like me how it was that I had ended up asleep on a dryer at three in the morning in full hiking gear when I had a bed just upstairs.\n\nHe said I should go to bed. I told him I didnt want to make Maggie up. He said that was stupid, but I insisted that I didnt want to. I dont know if he believed me. But he asked me if I needed a pillow or something to eat. I said no, thank you, I was good. He told me that Mike had an extra bed since his roommate moved out that I could sleep on. I said no, thank you. And he left. \n\nFive minutes later, he was back. He said to come with him. He had a sleeping bag that hed put on Mikes extra bed. I said that it was okay and that he should leave me alone, but he told me, again, that I was being stupid. And he was right. So I gathered myself and my belongings and went with him. Once he was satisfied that I would stay there, he grabbed a sandwich out of Mikes fridge, handed it to me, and left to go to sleep himself. Mike was curious and didnt share his discretion in asking what I was doing. I told him what I had done in a rather detached manner, feeling as though I owed him an explanation seeing as I was sleeping in his room. I slept almost immediately, and woke up after Mike had left for class. I rolled his sleeping bag neatly and wrote Mike a note thanking him for letting me use his bed and asking for him to not tell anyone what I had done. \n\nHe never mentioned it again.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': '3bieig', 'title': 'Trying to get out', 'author': 'bluematchbox', 'subreddit': 'offmychest', 'subreddit_id': '2ranw', 'body': '[Part One](http:\/\/redd.it\/3b7sjr)\\n[Part Two](http:\/\/redd.it\/3b8enj)\\n\\nA week or two after that Thanksgiving break, I became very anxious.

I would watch straight and gay porn and always have a feeling like gay porn is making me come quicker, but there's something about it that isn't me. I have lived the past half a year with HOCD, constantly questioning my sexuality, checking whether I find a man or a woman attractive. It's been eating my brain out. Then again, something happened with a girl after a party two weeks ago. When everyone went to sleep we started to kiss on the floor and I would end up sucking on her nipples. I liked the whole experience, during the time I was leaking a ton and then we stayed in touch. After a while we started sexting. I would get very horny talking to her about how I would finger her, lick her pussy, bang her, how she would suck me... When we are sexting, I am not even touching myself but my penis goes crazy, it leakes out a ton of preejaculate with every arousing thought. What scares me is that it isn't enough for me to finish and it always takes me more time to come, or sometimes I use porn to get to the end. It's really messed up, because... I had fantasies about sucking a nameless dick. If it was with a guy that I knew I probably wouldn't be so aroused. A women's touch does things for me that a man's touch can't. When a women touches me, even on the arm, I feel some emotion running through me. It even occured to me three weeks ago, when I was sleeping with a female friend. She was cold, so we cuddled and my penis was so erect... And I don't even find her that attractive, but when she touched me it all I could think about was touching her and other sexual thoughts. I liked the girl from the party very much. She and I began to have a relationship that gave me both romantic and sexual thoughts, or so I thought... I was texting her about how she should come to my place (we live a few towns away) and I was constantly having the thoughts about what I was gonna do to her. It turned out she can't come this weekend but invited me to her town... And something broke inside of me. I know we couldn't have sex at her place, as she lives with her parents and her brother. I suddenly lost the rush I was texting her with, even though I would like to meet her. I am starting to think that I only want to use her sexually to deny my gay thoughts and nothing else. It's tearing me apart. Before HOCD I always was a very romantic guy. Now I'm starting to fear that sex is driving me. That the fear of being gay makes me do things to women. I don't want to hurt that girl. I want the best for her. After she suggested I come to her town, I had a romantic dream about my ex girlfriend (these occur more often than they should even though it's been seven months since we split up) and I would wake up and some urge had me watch gay porn and come really quickly to it. Then I watched straight porn and I came too, but not as quickly. What the actual fuck. When I see naked women, when I sext the girl I am really turned on, but the problem lies in actually finishing. I don't want to have sex with guys.

Aged 11 I won the Great Britain Diving Federation Commenwealth Championships, and was basically told I was hot shit and on the path to the Olympics. I moved up from Novice to National (from 3m to 7.5\/10m boards) and discovered I have a complete phobia to heights. That started me on the path of emotional eating as I watched my Olympic dreams crumble, and I gave up diving seriously and started getting into Rugby and Football. Aged 17, I snapped the cartilage in my left knee, aged 19 I had to have keyhole surgery on my right knee, and I basically just went cold turkey from sport as I started hitting the pubs and bars around town instead of the gym. It wasn't unusual for me to get an extra ~6000 calories in beer every weekend around this period. I went from 12st (168lbs\/76kg) to 15st (210lbs\/95kg) over the course of 2 years, being 15st when I was 21.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of March this year and I found myself a shadow (metaphorically) of the man I was. On March 1st I was 5\"10 (177.8 cm) and still a massive 16st 2lbs \n(226lbs\/102.5kilos).\n\nThree major things have pushed me into losing weight. First, my wife has been consistently losing weight using the Bodyrock site and doing HIIT 5x a week since last October. Secondly, a trip to the doctor in February which put me on a steroid based Inhaler for my Asthma, where she basically told me being so fat doesn't help my uking@example.com. Thirdly, we've booked a dream holiday to take the kids to the states at the end of July, so I have something to really aim for.

I only weigh and add food to the MFP app, and never calculate exercise, instead treating that as 'bonus fat burned'. I aim to bike every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and lift as heavy as I can on Tuesday and Thursday (I only have a small set of barbell and dumbbells). I can't afford a gym membership for my wife and I while saving for the holiday (78 a month for the two of us at the local  \"Fusion Lifestyle\" gym, plus the cost of babysitters) as well as the fact the local gym is awful. 50 stations are advertised, but 40 of those are treadmills\/rowers\/bikes.

A simple math\/thought experiment\nThe text below was posted in an online community called ClickerHeroes in the year 2018:\n\nI've been reading a lot of threads where people are saying that $30 is too much to pay for CH2, and I've been trying to come up with a simple way of determining how much a video game should be worth to me.  That is, ignoring graphics, genre, etc.  \n\nThe simplest way I could come up with is this:  \n\n1) Find a paid for game that you've spent the most hours on (if all your games are on Steam, this is very easy).  For me, it's Skyrim with 1422 hours in.\n\n2) Find out the original price for the game ($49.99 US).  \n\n3) Divide the price by the amount of time you've spent.  (Approximately $.35 US).\n\nWhat this means is that in the game I've spent the most time in, I value one hour of gameplay at about $.35.  \n\n4) Find out how many hours you've spent in CH1 (301).\n\n5) Multiply the amount you got in step 3 by the amount you got in step 4. ($105.35)\n\nIf your answer (like mine) is greater than $30, then in all likelihood, CH2 will be worth $30 to you.  Why?  You've already spent however many hours in CH1, and CH2 is an improved version.  Not only does it have better graphics and setting, it adds skill trees and character customization.  All in all, the game looks like it will be a lot more interactive and enjoyable than CH1 (I won't tell you how many of my 301 hours have been surfing the web while waiting for an ascension to end).\n\nThe above is probably over simplified, but I've been considering using this type of formula for any game purchase I make - will I expect to spend enough hours in the game at $.35\/hour to equal the price I pay for the game.  \n\nOn a personal note, I will *not* be pre-ordering, but only because $30 is out of my price range at the moment.

This is my first ever post, so please bear with me. I had a pretty severe injury this past year which forced me to be sedentary for a long time and due to my immobility and less than stellar diet, my weight skyrocketed (at its worst, I was 200+ lbs. I'm M\/5'11\/23 btw). I'm fully recovered now and working out regularly, and I have been lurking on this sub for the past few weeks. I've done some periodic intermittent fasting, (not necessarily intentionally but mostly due to work) but I started my first extended fast roughly 62 hours ago, without really setting a limit on how far I would go. I've been drinking water, black coffee, green tea, as well as a small amount of Ultima electrolyte powder yesterday and today. I started my fast at 189 lbs and am currently sitting at 180 lbs. I know some of the weight will return, but the results both on the scale in the mirror have me pretty happy with my progress.  I feel way better than I thought I would, and to be honest I didn't think I would be able to get this far. I've always loved food, and admittedly I probably have a bit of an unhealthy relationship with it, definitely binge eating at times, but I am hoping this fast can give me a new perspective on my eating habits and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nLike I said, I feel great and could keep going, however, due to a social obligation that I really cannot skip out on, I have decided to break my fast this afternoon and have dinner and most likely a few alcoholic beverages later tonight. I drank a cup of black coffee this morning and am currently sipping on some green tea, and plenty of water in between. So my question is what is the best way to break my fast today, keeping in mind I will be eating dinner and drinking later? I know I'm supposed to ease into it and was planning on eating a small salad with some almonds and dried cranberries, and maybe some juice, but I've also seen some people say it doesn't necessarily matter for a fast of just 2-3 days. I'd like to avoid having an upset stomach later tonight if at all possible, and I generally don't have trouble with drinking and nausea, but I've never gone this long without eating either, so any advice for this situation would be much appreciated. I'm also open to advice on what kind of drinks to indulge in later tonight. I usually drink light beer or mixed vodka, rum, gin, or whiskey drinks. This definitely won't be my last extended fast, and I hope to try for a full 72 hours in the future, if not longer. You guys influence more people than you know and I can't express how much the positivity in this sub has inspired me to take control of my body and enjoy all the benefits that fasting has to offer.

She has had upwards of 15 partners. Some flings, ONS, a couple small relationships.\n\nI guess, I feel sad and a little depressed sometimes that I have never got to experience the full spectrum of sexuality (in a relative sense) like she has. What makes matters worse is that she is very uninterested in sex generally and when we do have it things seem limited\/restricted.\n\nIt makes me feel more intimidated and jealous.

I know it can be much harder for some than others, I have read their horror stories. But coming off of H was the hardest thing Ive ever done. I had a 2g habit and cold turkey'd that stuff which I ended up in the hospital for. My mom came and found me in my house with the power off and 94 degrees inside, I was lying on the floor under a table talking about my gf who worked at space Walmart. Was in hospital for a week in and out of icu. Guess I had been seizing for days. Good grief that hurts to tell. The hospital told my mom that I had fried my brain and would need after care, honestly it took me a while to get my head back together. But that was just more clean time.\n\nSo after I got home my mom wouldnt let me leave her site as she knew if I relapsed that would be it. She drove me to meetings and I talked with others and decided to get on the med you can get at the pharmacy. Unsure about using those words here. I didnt have to stand in line though. Quickly I found a way to abuse those and had to figure out something else. I got completely sober and the wds from those meds after a month and a half led me to kratom. So Kratom was this miracle supplement that helped addicts get it together and I really couldnt find any negatives whatsoever. Well kinda pricey at the headshop but quickly found a plug for kilos. I have been taking it daily since I found it. It was oh so helpful for me at first and it felt great I felt like myself again and then I dont know when or where but it turned on me. I had to have it for vacations,long drives, if I was staying out for the night I had to know I had some there was always some stashed in the car. Four years flew by me and I had isolated, stopped vacationing and going to see music and friends out of town. Then it was movies, grocery store any reason I could think of that would be better on Kratom. I wanted my old self back but I still wouldnt stop abusing. When I say 60+ gpd it was always plus but the last week I was averaging 80 gpd and I couldnt stop myself from redosing or trying bigger doses. I knew then that the addiction had to stop. It took me three times to stop using dope, this is my third blankenshipryan@example.com.

Hopefully this helps get the point across that I am not trying to trivialise this matter, I am trying to make a very serious point.    \n\nFrom this point onwards, all posts made to this subreddit either as regular posts or as comments in the community post pertaining to suicide will be removed.

New to Reddit, new to r\/childfree, not new to being Childfree with a capital C. Ive known since I was 12 that I didnt want kids. I work with children of parents struggling with addiction, and I love it, because thats what I was. The facility where I work helps addicted women stop using, learn heathy coping skills, address their traumas and co-occurring mental health issues, and learn how to parent. Because really, it is something that needs to be taught. Unfortunately, its generally learned from ones parents, and for addicted people, their parents are often part of the problem. This is why theres a cycle of addiction within families, and also a cycle of shitty parenting.\n\nSometimes, the clients that I work with will sneer at me and say What do you know about raising kids? You dont even have any! Usually this comes after I tell them they cant spank their children at our facility (My parents spanked me and I turned out fine  clearly, thats why youre in treatment) or some other correction of their parenting.\n\nMy response used to be Because I dont have children, I have time to learn about child psychology, child development, behavioral disorders, disciplinary methods, and all the stuff you dont have time to read about because youre just trying to keep yourself and your kiddo alive. At this point Ive been at my job for almost 5 years, and my response is much simpler: Ive had over 400 kids since Ive been here.\n\nI used to be the person who rolled my eyes at the screaming child at the restaurant. My thinking was get it under control or get it out of here. I know now that its not that simple. And when parents just say knock it off and dont actually do anything to address the behavior, it tells me thats probably how they were raised. I treat every child I meet with kindness and compassion, but I make my boundaries clear and remind the child of those boundaries as often as is necessary.\n\nI dont know where I was going with this. Just because you dont want kids, doesnt mean you dislike them. I wish parenting classes were required for all parents, because if every parent took the classes that the clients at my facility take, there wouldnt be so many shithead kids in the world, and they wouldnt grow up to raise shithead kids of their own.","meta":"{'source': 'reddit_posts', 'id': '8wpt3d', 'title': 'I actually really like kids', 'author': 'EmilyPseu', 'subreddit': 'childfree', 'subreddit_id': '2qtwb', 'body': 'I just dont want any of my own. \\n\\nHi.
